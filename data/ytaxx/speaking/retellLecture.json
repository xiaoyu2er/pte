    "passage": "For centuries, boys were top of the class. But these days, that's no longer the case. A new study by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, examined how 15-year-old boys and girls performed at reading, mathematics, and science. Boys still score somewhat better at maths, and in science the genders are roughly equal. But when it comes to the students who really struggle, the difference is stark: boys are 50% more likely than girls to fall short of basic standards in all three areas. Researchers suggest that doing homework set by teachers is linked to better performance in maths, reading, and science. Boys, it appears, spend more of their free time in the virtual world; they are 17% more likely than girls to play collaborative online games than girls every day. They also use the internet more. Third, peer pressure plays a role. A lot of boys decide early on that they are just too cool for school which means they're more likely to be rowdy in class. Teachers mark them down for this. In anonymous tests, boys perform better. In fact, the gender gap in reading drops by a third when teachers don't know the gender of the pupil they are marking. So what can be done to close this gap? Getting boys to do more homework and cut down on screen-time would help.. But most of all, abandoning gender stereotypes would benefit all students. Boys in countries with the best schools read much better than girls. And girls in Shanghai excel in mathematics. They outperform boys from anywhere else in the world.Sample answer：1）15-year-old boys and girls performed at reading, mathematics, and science.2）Boysspend more of their free time in the virtual world; they are 17% more likely than girls to play collaborative online games than girls every day.

    "passage": "In today's class we'll be examining some nineteenth-century pattern books that were used for building houses. I think it's fair to say that these pattern books were the most important influence on the design of North American houses during the nineteenth century. This was because most people who wanted to build a house couldn't afford to hire an architect. Instead, they bought a pattern book, picked out a plan, and took it to the builder. The difference in cost was substantial. In 1870, for example, hiring an architect would've cost about a hundred dollars. At the same time, a pattern book written by an architect cost only five dollars. At that price, it's easy to see why pattern books were so popular. Some are back in print again today, and of course they cost a lot more than they did a hundred years ago. But they're an invaluable resource for historians, and also for people who restore old houses. I have a modern reprint here that I'll be passing around the room in a moment so that everyone can have a look.Sample answer:1) Pattern books were the most important influence on the design of North American houses during the nineteenth century.2) Most people who wanted to build a house couldn't afford to hire an architect.

Well, 200 years ago roughly coincides with the beginning of the industrial revolution in the Northern Hemisphere. In other words, this was when our production of harmful gases really got going as a result of increased industrialization. Since that time our production of gases has accelerated due to the fact that not only has industry grown in size but it has also now spread to the Southern Hemisphere, indeed, most parts of the world. So, in the last 200 years, as industry has grown we can see a gradual rise in the temperatures which, to my mind is sufficient proof of the damaging effect of our actions and needless to say it's an issue which we need to address.Sample answer:1.Climate change is a result of human activities.2.There is evidence which clearly demonstrates that our own actions are causing a genuine threat.3.

Of course there's lots of sugar in donuts or ice cream, or pastries, or other things that are sweet; candy of course, but there are other places where you see it and you don't necessarily expect it. So as an example: peanut butter. Here's a list of ingredients from Skippy Peanut Butter and you see that sugar is the second most common ingredient. So that you may know from reading food labels that these ingredients in any food label are listed in order of how much there is in the food itself, so sugar comes right after peanuts. Here's another example, Beef stew, you wouldn't necessarily expect to find sugar in beef stew but it's there. Now it's down the list of ingredients, it's actually toward the end, but if you look at the marketing of this and look at the can, it says, there's fresh potatoes and carrots, but actually there's more sugar in this than there is in carrots. And so you wouldn't eat something like beef stew and expect to find this to be the case. Here's another example, where you have high fructose corn syrup, is the source of sugar is in ketchup.Sample answer:The lecture was about the amount of sugar in foods, which comprised sugar in sweets and donuts.

    "passage": "So let me begin with the notion of a dimension, the dimension is simply how many numbers that you need to specify a location. So if we think about the surface of the earth, the equator is one-dimensional. You need to specify only one number to specify the location on the equator, namely the longitude. The surface of the Earth altogether is, of course, two-dimensional. You need to specify two numbers, the latitude and longitude, to specify location on the earth. The space above the earth is three-dimensional. If I wanna tell you a location of a hang glider, I need to give you the latitude, longitude and altitude. But mathematically there's no reason to stop at three dimensions. A four-dimensional space is simply a space that you need to specify four numbers to specify a location.

And all those only one is in the first century, there are none at all at the second or third century. There is only one in the late third century and there is four in the fourth century. So if you are a historian trying to write the history of Rome in London, it's really difficult. You don't have much data, you're going to depend on the archaeological evidence, the material evidence of the port and indeed the town to have any understanding of what happened then. And so, what we're looking at here is how did we discover about the port of London, there is no historical documentations, no customs books, no terrorists, no idea of the taxes. We have to understand the port entirely from the archaeological evidence. So that's what we are going to do today. So, if we move on to the next slide, I love live streaming.

There is only one in the late third century and there is four in the fourth century. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">So if you are a historian trying to write the history of Rome in London, it's really difficult. You don't have much data, you're going to depend on the archaeological evidence, the material evidence</span> of the port and indeed the town to have any understanding of what happened then. And so, what we're looking at here is how did we discover about the port of London, there is no historical documentations, no customs books, no terrorists, no idea of the taxes. <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">We have to understand the port entirely from the archaeological evidence.</span> So that's what we are going to do today. So, if we move on to the next slide, I love live streaming. Thank you very much.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>",

We're usually given a reading lists which we have to complete before each tutorial. We are given websites to look at, e-journals to look at. And we have to prepare by writing our notes down. In every tutorial there's about five to fifteen students, and these are led by the tutors, which are usually Masters or PhD students. And then when we come into the tutorial we are put into small groups and we are asked to discuss our ideas, generate new ideas, and then feed back to the class. During our tutorials there's lots of support given. Our tutors are there so that we can ask questions at any time. We also have our peers there which we can also ask questions to. If we need help before the tutorial we can email in any of the tutors and they'll provide you with help. The difference between lectures and tutorials is that in lectures you usually have about two hundred to three hundred students, whereas in tutorials it's about five to fifteen students, which allows you to discuss matters, put your hand up, and talk to your tutors about any difficulties you may have with the subject.\nSample answer:1.The lecture is about tutorial.2.Students need to prepare before the tutorial.3.Students are put into small groups to generate new ideas.4.There will be lots of support provided by tutors or peers.5.There are much less students in the tutorial than lectures so you can discuss any difficulties you have in the subjects.",

This is sometimes called level measurement. Firstly, we have category type questions, which are also known as nominal questions. These are when participants select from a list of categories for their response, such as male or female or they may include ethnic origin. Secondly, we have ordinal type questions. These are similar to category questions. But instead of the categories being independent, there is some sort of order between them. If we ask people to indicate their age in categories. This is an ordinal type question. Thirdly, we have continuous questions. These are any questions that can be answered by a number. It could be an open-ended question asking participants to tell you how many times they attended lectures or how often they used a VLE.

On the right, the constellation Orion appears to approach the event horizon. The boundary from which nothing can escape. Orion stars look like they become separated and get spun around. Once the hole has passed by, Orion reappears on the left and looks normal again. Users can also experiment with different scenarios.",

On the right, the constellation Orion appears to approach the event horizon. The boundary from which nothing can escape. Orion stars look like they become separated and get spun around. Once the hole has passed by, Orion reappears on the left and looks normal again. Users can also experiment with different scenarios.",
      "The lecture is mainly about financial situation in student loans.\nAt the early stage of this lecture, the speaker mentioned her loans have been accumulating at the rate of 10 percent and might never be paid off.\nAfter that, she further mentioned because of her own loans she might not support her children’s education.\nTo sum up, people would choose a college they could afford both during and after graduation."

On the right, the constellation Orion appears to approach the event horizon. The boundary from which nothing can escape. Orion stars look like they become separated and get spun around. Once the hole has passed by, Orion reappears on the left and looks normal again. Users can also experiment with different scenarios.",
      "The lecture is mainly about financial situation in student loans.\nAt the early stage of this lecture, the speaker mentioned her loans have been accumulating at the rate of 10 percent and might never be paid off.\nAfter that, she further mentioned because of her own loans she might not support her children’s education.\nTo sum up, people would choose a college they could afford both during and after graduation."

This reflects the environmentalists' maxim, 'think globally act locally'. United Kingdom legislative control over the impacts of mans' activity on the environment is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of 'sea coal. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by 'self-regulation' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect.\nThe next stage was prompted by the Industrial Revolution with the urbanization of society and its profound effects on the environment. Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximize their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of 'Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good.\nThose industrialists who were concerned for either the health of their employees or the local environment faced higher costs than their competitors. The result was the need for increasingly comprehensive statutory controls on the discharge of pollutants into various receiving media.\nSample answer:\n1.Domestic legislation is within the sovereign states and reflects the environmentalists' maxim. 2.The main concern during the time of Charles II was the production of smoke from the burning of sea coal. 3.Although some areas were governed by self-regulation, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective due to the lack of appropriate enforcement. 4.As a result, increasingly comprehensive statutory controls are needed in order to protect local environment.",

All products must have a BSI license to get access into the market. There are two types of standard. One is compulsory, and the other one is elective. Under the compulsory standard, the products cannot come into the market unless they meet the requirements. Otherwise, without the license, these products will be seen as illegal. This is for the purpose of safety. Take matchboxes as an example.\n</p></p>",

The warning information is only displayed at the back. This design is very concerning. The warning font is small, which makes it even more difficult to read. 60% of Americans cannot recognize fonts smaller than size 10, and 40% of Americans are illiterate. While people cannot recognize easily or cannot read, they won&rsquo;t be aware of the haphazardness of these chemical products.</p>",

    "passage": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GAruNulfy0 [19:47 - 21:19]\nText:Turner, not surprisingly, painted one of the earliest pictures of London's fog, in the 1835 painting, the Thames above Waterloo Bridge. Turner is a trueborn Londoner, is advertising his familiarity with London's air problem by putting smoke and atmospheric pollution at its centre. And as you can see, in here, the bridge is the central elements which is a theme that's later taken up by Monet. And it's partly obscured by the steam and smoke which rises from both sides of the river. Here, we see a shot-tower. I think you can just about to see it, which was constructed in 1826. Do you know what shot-towers are? They produce shot for guns, ammunition. And they were very smoky, one of the more smoking industries. But it's barely visible, as you can see, as are the various industries on the Lambeth side of the river. There's, on this side, there's a steam ship about to dock or preparing to leave, its black smoke thrusting up to join the kind of swirling arc of smoke there. William Rodner sees this painting as a potent essay on the energy and complexity of modern polluted urbanism. Smoke, I think, here represents for a flourishing economy, which brings employment and food on tables, but also the dirt and pollution associated with the fumes. All seems to be tainted by sulphurous yellow.\nSample Answer:\n1.Turner painted one of the earliest pictures of London's frog in the 1835.2.He was a Londoner and familiar with its air problem.3.In the picture we can see a bridge, shot-tower, and steam ship, they are all covered by steam and smoke.4.Some people see this painting as an essay on the energy and modern polluted urbanism. 5.Speaker thinks that the smoke represents the flourishing economy and pollution.",

Some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world.

NGOs are difficult to define, and the term &lsquo;NGO' is rarely used consistently. As a result, there are many different classifications in use. The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation\". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.\nSample Answer: This lecture mainly talks about the non-governmental organization.

However, the application of new equipment has potential risk in damaging reputation if any errors occur. Therefore, it is suggested that the business should operate both machines together, so that a comparison of efficiency can be drawn to control risks in reputation even at the cost of depreciation of machinery.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">The sample answer is derived from candidates’ recalls</p>",

    "answer": "Sample answer: This lecture talked about the developments in physics, which include many famous scientists' major discoveries, such as Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. The discovery of new laws in Thermodynamics, Chemistry, and Electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial Revolution. These physical laws are widely used and theories simplify their classical equivalents. In conclusion, inaccuracies and high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.",
    "passage": "Text:Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics.\nMajor developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the solar system with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by Johannes Kepler between 1609 and 1619, pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by Galileo Galilei in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name. Newton also developed calculus, the mathematical study of change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problem.\nThe discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial Revolution as energy needs increased. The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.\nSample answer: This lecture talked about the developments in physics, which include many famous scientists' major discoveries, such as Kepler, Galileo, and Newton.

Now you are billions of degree. You never get to zero that way. You get closer and closer, but you never get to zero. So that&rsquo;s why we cannot get to absolute zero.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><br/><br/>",

    "answer": "Sample Answer: \nThe general topic of this lecture is about Australian immigrants history. First, the lecture mentioned that it happened during a closed stage when the sea level was much lower; second, after that sea level rose and Australian remained contact with New Guinea and other continents. Next, there were about 20000 refugees who moved to Australia. In the end, Australia therefore became a multicultural society which included many immigrants from Asia.",
    "passage": "Text:The first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present indigenous people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40000to 43000 years Before Present, while the upper range supported by others is 60000 to 70000 years BP.\nIn any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100 to150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.\nThe ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversity and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Penisula.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s around 120000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration AI Grass by termed \"multiculturalism\". In 2004-5, Australia accepted 123000 new settles, 19 a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40000 in 200405) moved to Sydney. The majority of immigrants came from Asia, led by China and India.\nSample Answer: The general topic of this lecture is about Australian immigrants history.

    "passage": "StraightSalary\n\nStraight salary sales compensation plans aren't very common, but they do have a place in some organizations. With this type of structure, you'd pay your salespeople a straight albeit competitive salary like all of your other employees, and nothing else. No bonuses, no commissions, and few, if any, sales incentives. This type of compensation plan is most often used when the industry you operate within prohibits direct sales, whensalespeople work as part of small groups or teams and all contributions are equal, when your sales team is relatively small, or when your salespeople are expected to spend much of their time on other responsibilities other than selling. However, these plans don't tend to offer motivation to salespeople, as there are no incentives for them to work harder.\n\nSalary plus Commission\n\nSalary plus commission sales compensation plans are possibly the most common plans used today. They're structured in a way that salespeople receive a lower base salary along with commission pay that makes up the majority of the total compensation.\nOrganizations use salary plus commission sales compensation plans when there are opportunities to support all salespeople on this structure and when there are proper metrics in place for tracking sales to ensure that the splits are fair and accurate.\nThis type of plan is often the better choice as opposed to straight salary because it offers motivation to increase productivity and to achieve goals. It also offers more stability. Salespeople will still get some types of pay even if they're in training, when sales are low during certain months, or if market conditions get volatile. However, it can be more complex to administer.\n\nCommission Only\n\nCommission only sales compensation plans are exactly what they sound like you pay your sales people for the sales they bring in and nothing else. There is no guarantee of income.\nThese types of plans are easier to administer than salary plus commission and provide better value for your money paid as they are based solely on sales achieved. They also tend to attract fewer candidates, but do attract the most top-performing and hardest working sales professionals who know they can make a good income because they know how to sell. On the other hand, though, they can create aggression within your sales team and low income security, which can lead to a high turnover rate, and sales rep burnout from stress.\n\nSample Answer:\n1.There are different types of sales incentives.\n2.Salary plan means fixed salary.\n3.Commission plan means paying in direct proportion to sales, and it's the only amount of money sales get paid.\n4.While combination plan includes both salary and commission, which means superior employee can get extra rewards.",

However, in Australia, many citizens still bear a mortgage even when they are in proximity of retirement. In conclusion, for these people, the mortgage is lifelong and government should put more efforts to relieve their burden so that the household cycle for Australians can be more healthy and dynamic.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\"><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">The sample answer is derived from candidates’ recalls</p></p>\r\n",

People buy drugs depending on what they saw on the ads. Despite medicine ads may be technically accurate, they are misleading in tones. Depression patients, for example, may feel better after taking the medicine. However, it does not mean there is a change in their lifestyle. Therefore, buying a certain prescription medicine is not like buying a soap, it takes a sober mind and careful decision and understanding of what we really need to improve.",
    "passage": "Text:The amount of money drug companies spend on TV ads has doubled in recent years. And it's no wonder studies show the commercials work: consumers go to their doctors with a suggestion for a certain prescription drug they saw advertised on TV. Now a study in the Annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message these ads promote, NPR'S Patty Neighmond reports. You're most likely to see drug ads during prime times, especially around the news. Researchers analysed 38 ads aimed at people with conditions like hypertension, herpes, high cholesterol, depression, arthritis and allergies. The drug industry says the ads arm consumers with information. But researchers found that although the information was technically accurate, the tone was misleading. UCLA psychologist Dominick Frosch headed the study. \"What we would see in these ads is that before taking a prescription drug, the character's life is out of control and the loss of control extended beyond the impact of their health condition.\"\nFor example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days, insomniacs utterly out of synch on the job and depressed patients friendless and boring at parties. \"When the character is then shown taking the drug, he then magically regains complete control of his life.\" \nNone of the ads mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition. That's not surprising, given that the ads are just another form of mass marketing. But prescription medicines are not like soap.\nSample answer：The lecture is about advertising, where the advertisement on medicine prescription has doubled, compared to its prime time. People buy drugs depending on what they saw on the ads. Despite medicine ads may be technically accurate, they are misleading in tones. Depression patients, for example, may feel better after taking the medicine. However, it does not mean there is a change in their lifestyle. Therefore, buying a certain prescription medicine is not like buying a soap, it takes a sober mind and careful decision and understanding of what we really need to improve.",

Your body is also where 10 times that number of bacteria call 'home sweet home.' But don't be afraid - these bacteria do more good than harm to you. And besides, just in case you wanted to strike up a conversation with <span style=\"color:black;\">your tenants,</span> you and your bacteria <span style=\"color:black;\">do have a few things in common</span>. All cells share some<span style=\"color:black;\"> common characteristics</span> that make them living things. <span style=\"color:black;\">All organisms are composed of cells, the basic fundamental unit of life. They contain DNA as a heritable genetic material, and they can reproduce</span>. They transcribe DNA into RNA and translate RNA into proteins on ribosomes. They can also regulate transport across a cell membrane and require chemical energy for some cellular processes. <span style=\"color:black;\">Organelles are the biggest difference between bacteria and cells that make up the human body Organelles</span>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>",

    "passage": "Text:Variation in frogs - Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short--bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura. The oldest fossil \"proto--frog\" appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is found in tropical rainforests. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-- permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs also produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly when they are in breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to turned off predators and to generally survive. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them. Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion.\nSample Answer: Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group, which is widely distributed, and the greatest concentration of species diversity is found in tropical rainforests.

Curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so. The need to Improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries. Improved equity is also important because of the demand of high-skilled workers, and improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion.",
    "passage": "Text:When Australians engage in debate about educational quality or equity, they often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both at the same time. Curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so because they increase breadth or differentiation in offerings in a way that increases differences in quality. Further, these differences in quality often reflect differences in students' social backgrounds because the 'new' offerings are typically taken up by relatively disadvantaged students who are not served well them. Evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point. The need to Improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries as they seek to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern, knowledge economies. Improved equity is also important for this purpose, since the demand for high---level skills is widespread and the opportunities for the low---skilled are diminishing. Improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion. There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.\nSample Answer: Australians seem to accept that a country cannot achieve educational quality or equity at the same time.

But you know, sometimes people say it dies when the second-last person who speaks it dies, because the last person has nobody to talk to. Well, of course, languages have come and gone throughout history as communities have come and gone. But what's happening now is something really quite extraordinary. Well, there are about 6000 languages in the world at the moment, more or less. Nobody knows the exact number. Of these, about half of them are so seriously in danger, are likely to die out in the course of present century. Now the present century is a hundred years, half is 3000 languages. So, that means one language is dying out somewhere in the world average every two weeks. There are all kinds of reasons why languages die; one is physical reason when people are affected by famine, disease and earthquake. Another is genocide, when some countries deliberately stamp out a small language. The main reason is globalization. That is, some huge languages in the world, like English, Arabic, Spanish and French, and these are like stream rollers crushing the smaller languages they find in their path. A great deal can be done to preserve endangered language. The first thing is that the people themselves must want the language to be preserved. That's very important. The second thing is that the powers- that- be must want the language to be preserved. They must be respect for the minority languages in their care. The third thing has to be there, of course, is cash. It costs quite a lot of money to preserve an endangered language. Think about it, you have to train the teachers, you have to write books for the children. And all sorts of things. It doesn't cost a extraordinary amount money, but it does cost a bit.

Ok, we have a monkey sitting at a typewriter and the claim here is basically if you leave chance in time long enough you will get life, don't worry about it, yes, its's strange, yes, it's wonderful, but leave enough matter 600 million years on earth and you will have life. So, the monkey sitting at the typewriter the chances are eventually he produces the complete works of Shakespeare so what's the problem. So, there's no problem. There's no issue, right? You just leave it long enough and you'll find. And one key striker seconds, the monkey might well eventually get to you the complete works of Shakespeare but he doesn't manage to do it in 600 million years. So, what I decided to do is to run the numbers. I, instead of saying typing the complete work of Shakespeare, I just run the numbers for how long would it take a monkey typing one key striker a second. To type \"to be or not to be that is the question'. Right? On average how long is it gonna take my monkey friend one keystroke a second. I don't know how you think it would be. Maybe you could have a guess. Would it be less or more than 600 million years, which is the period life on earth isn't supposed to have emerge within and when I run the numbers\" to be or not to be is the question' takes 12.6 trillion trillion trillion years to type just that phrase and a DNA string has got as much as information the encyclopedia Britannica. Are we saying that something of that complexity emerges by chance undirected within 600 million years? Again, it's mathematically possible but it's so incredibly unlikely that it would have that it tilts me in favour of the Christian story in which God creating life, simply a question of saying let that be and there was.\nSample answer:1.The speaker talks about the infinite monkey theorem.2.

      "This simulation shows what you might see if you are orbiting a black hole. The light and position of background stars around the hole are distorted by its gravity and they seem to spin around. On the right, the constellation Orion appears to approach the event horizon. The boundary from which nothing can escape. Orion stars look like they become separated and get spun around. Once the hole has passed by, Orion reappears on the left and looks normal again. Users can also experiment with different scenarios.",
      "The lecture is mainly about financial situation in student loans.\nAt the early stage of this lecture, the speaker mentioned her loans have been accumulating at the rate of 10 percent and might never be paid off.\nAfter that, she further mentioned because of her own loans she might not support her children’s education.\nTo sum up, people would choose a college they could afford both during and after graduation."
