From the first illustrated ${catalog} of medicinal plants, De Materia Medica by Dioscorides, in the first century through to the late fourteenth century, the illustration of plants and animals changed very little. \r\nWoodcuts in instructional manuals and herbals were often repeatedly copied over the centuries, resulting in a loss of definition and accuracy so that they became little more than stylized decoration. With the growing ${popularity} of copperplate engravings, the traditional use of woodcuts declined and the representation of plants and animals became more ${accurate}. Then, with the emergence of artists such as Albrecht Durer and Leonardo Da Vinci, naturalists such as Otto Brunfels, Leonhard Fuchs in botany and Conrad Gesner and Ulisse Aldrovandi in zoology, nature began to be ${depicted} in a more realistic style. Individual living plants or animals were observed directly and their likeness ${rendered} onto paper or vellum.",

The body of the article is devoted to teasing out the distinctive basis of its appeal compared with earlier management theory. It is seen to build upon earlier efforts (e.g. 'theory Y') to constitute a self-disciplining form of employee subjectivity by asserting that 'practical autonomy ' is conditional upon the development of a strong corporate culture. The paper illuminates the dark side of this project by drawing attention to the subjugating and totalitarian implications of its excellence/ quality prescriptions. To this end, parallels are drawn with the philosophy ofcontrolfavored by the Party in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Specifically, the paper critiques the 'doublethink ' contention that autonomy can be realized in mono-cultural conditions that systematically constrain opportunities to wrestle with competing values standpoints and their associated life projects.</p>",
