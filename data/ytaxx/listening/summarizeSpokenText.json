    "answer": "Sample answer:The Great Exhibition in 1851 gave us the world's premier taxi service. Many people could not find their way to the exhibition. London Authority sets up Public Carriage to license taxi drivers. Taxi drivers are required to pass the London knowledge exam. They need to remember streets, arterial roads, and points of specific interest, which is part of their training.",
    "passage": "Text:But we can really thank the Great Exhibition of 1851 for giving us the world's premier taxi service, for it was going to this exhibition, and this fabulous exhibition inventions from all around the four corners of the Empire that the visitors were appalled, dismayed and vexed by their journeys to this exhibition because the cabbies of the day, and their horse-drawn carts were absolutely terrible, could not find their way to this exhibition. And, so, a great public outcry, the London Authority sets up Public Carriage Office, which is an organization that still exists. And you can take a short walk to Penton Street up the road. And this Public Carriage office took on the responsibility of licensing all major taxi drivers in London. All taxi drivers from 1851 onwards had to pass what is now known as the London knowledge, was phenomenal knowledge of London. What is the London knowledge? It's the ability to remember the 25,000 streets, have it all interconnected and all the main arterial roads in and out of London. Cabbies need to know all this plus a thousand points of specific interest cafes, bars, public offices. They need to know them all as part of their training.\n",

An ice core is a continuous section of ice drilled into a glacier or an ice sheet. We're sending this instrument down which is just a cutting tool and the thing goes down a meter at a time.

People consider that looking at scenes of nature is known to have an effect on people's health and well-being, and there is an experiment to compare two groups of people who are in a real view or virtual view, which turns out that people's recovery from stress is faster in the room with the real view.

So for someone who's ill, for a patient in a hospital, does a virtual view of a garden have the same impact as a real one? Does it have the same beneficial effects when you look at it? Because that would be good. Well, um, if you test this out, if you put a group of people in a room with a real view and another group of people in a room with a virtual view - an unreal view - you can see what happens when they get stressed. If you give both groups a task that is slightly stressful and increases their heart rate and, um, what you'll find is that the people who have the real garden scene outside their window to look at - their heart rate goes back to normal more quickly than those of the people in the other group who only have a virtual view to look at.

If you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria, like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57% of boys entering or men, I guess, are negotiating for salary, and only 7% of women. And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves and women attribute it to other external factors. If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, I'm awesome. If you ask, obviously. Why are you even asking? If you ask women why they did a good job? What they'll say is someone helped them they got lucky, they worked really hard. Why does this matter? Boy, it matters a lot.

    "answer": "Sample answer: Andrew Carnegie was born in Scotland in 1835, and he had worked in telegraph office, railroad system and oil company, and he always did well at everything he set mind to. Carnegie was a wealthy man, but he spent his money on worthy causes rather than on himself. He gave away 90% of his fortune, so he is selfless and considered as a philanthropist. (67 words)",
    "passage": "原文：Andrew Carnegie was born in Scotland in 1835. His family moved to America when he was 13 and settled in Pittsburgh. He found jobs working in a fabric mill and telegraph office. Carnegie always did well at whatever he set his mind to. He was known to make improvements to any job he held. While working for the telegraph office, he began studying the railroad system, and he soon became the superintendent. \nHe took the money he had saved and invested in an oil company. His investment return was good and then he went to England to learn how to make steel. He wanted to make steel that was cheaper and more durable than American steel. He came back with his knowledge and built a huge steel factory. Carnegie's Factory was very successful and he sold it for 480 million dollars. Carnegie was a very wealthy man but he was more interested in philanthropy than spending his money on himself. He spent the rest of his life giving his money away to worthy causes. Reading and learning were very important to him, so he built many libraries. He also established universities and research institutes. Carnegie built hospitals, museums, and theaters. One of the most recognizable buildings he built was Carnegie Hall in New York City. Carnegie Hall hosts many concerts and symphonies each year and is an important part of New York City culture. Andrew Carnegie passed away at the age of 83. In his lifetime he gave away 90% of his fortune. He is known as a man who was selfless and wanted to do good for others. ",

Some climate models predict subtle changes. Others forecast rising sea levels which could flood coastal areas around the world. Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent. Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas and species unable to adapt to the changing conditions would face extinction. Although much remains to be learned about global warming, many organizations advocate cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impact of global warming. Consumers can help by saving energy around the house, switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs and driving fewer miles in the car each week.

So as an example: peanut butter. Here's a list of ingredients from Skippy Peanut Butter and you see that sugar is the second most common ingredient. So that you may know from reading food labels that these ingredients in any food label are listed in order of how much there is in the food itself, so sugar comes right after peanuts. Here's another example, Beef stew, you wouldn't necessarily expect to find sugar in beef stew but it's there. Now it's down the list of ingredients, it's actually toward the end, but if you look at the marketing of this and look at the can, it says, there's fresh potatoes and carrots, but actually there's more sugar in this than there is in carrots.

What's less certain is what rising temperatures mean for the planet. Some climate models predict subtle changes. Others forecast rising sea levels, which could flood coastal areas around the world. Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent. Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas, and species unable to adapt to the changing conditions would face extinction, although much remains to be learned about global warming. Many organizations advocate cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impact of global warming. Consumers can help by saving energy around the house, switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs, and driving fewer miles in the car each week.

When foragers returned to the hive they stopped bees dancing. Scientists think the behavior warns dancers of a dangerous source of nectar.\nSample Answer:Honey bees do a waggle dance to direct other bees to the source of nectar. According to a research, foraging bees were introduced to the dangers in the experiment, so they returned to hive to stop the dancing bees, In conclusion, we can know that a headbutt is a warning signal, and the behavior warns dancing bees about the dangers from the nectar. （63 words）",

Then, the author mentioned examples such as televisions in the Australia and Starbucks in China. The author thinks that the answer depends on who you talk to.

    "passage": "The question today of what makes a luxury brand a luxury brand and how do we distinguish itis very hard to answer. The standard business response is to say they are more exclusive. And we get exclusivity by having high priceand relatively small amounts of the product available. The reality, however, of luxury brands is that they are sold in their millions, and in some cases, are not priced that much higher than the standard output. The only way I can really answer your question is to say, it is all relative. As you said in your introduction, it wasn't that long ago in Australia that we would have considered two televisions to be a luxury, or even further back, one colour television. And you can make a strong argument, for example, that Starbucks in China, right now, is a luxury purchase because of its cost, because of how frequently it is purchased by many people. So, I think the long answer is a complicated one, but the answer is, it depends who you talk to.I think in the business community what we would say, is that there is a small cluster of more expensive brands which have a distinct strategy that we would identify as being luxury brands. And they start with the Rolls Royce and the Tiffanys and the Louis Vuittons of the world. And, I think that tends to be how we see them.\n",

    "answer": "Sample answer:This lecture is mainly about vitamin D. Firstly, the speaker mentions that vitamin D is a prohormone. Secondly, the speaker also states that people can obtain vitamin D from sun exposure. Moreover, the speaker argues that people who live in tropical climates and equator regions have enough vitamin D. Lastly, other people need to take vitamin D in food due to inadequate sunlight in winter. (65 words)",
    "passage": "So today we're going to finish talking about the fat soluble vitamins. I'm going to start with Vitamin D. And I think probably most of you know that Vitamin D is called the \"sunshine vitamin\". And it's called that because there's absolutely no dietary need for vitamin D if you get adequate sunshine. And the real important word there is \"if\" because it turns out that in climates which aren't near the equator there's a big question as to whether human beings get adequate sunshine. And that's important because foods are not naturally abundant in vitamin D. And that's why milk is fortified but the fortification may not be enough. So again just exposure to sunlight is adequate, no need for vitamin D. So Vitamin D really isn't the Vitamin, it's a prohormone when human beings evolve, we evolved in tropical climates and ran around naked. There was plenty of skin exposure to sunlight. And so there was no dietary need for Vitamin D. As humans migrated away from that tropical regions, they actually created a need for Vitamin D in food because sunlight was inadequate, particularly during the winter.\n",

Beauty is an arrogant word, and it is all in the eye of the beholder.

I think why did they built that and with terribly without architecture.

A bad building has a serious impact for, could be hundreds of years on the people around it.

But what has changed since then? <span style=\"color:black;\">It's just in the last few years, brain science has started to seriously investigate music and this young science is confirming music's power over us. For example, some colleagues in Montreal decided to do a study to investigate what happens in the brain when people get chills to music</span>. This is intense emotional responses that often manifest themselves as shivers tingling of the spines. Anybody here had this? OK, it's not uncommon. And they specifically looked at chills - instrumental music. So this wasn't due to any associations that people had with lyrics. It was just sounds of music and they looked it. They took advantage of the fact that people often know quite well what music gives them chills they know piece, sometimes the very passage in the piece and so they had people bring in their own self-selected CDs and they scan their brains while they were having these experiences listening to music.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>",

    "answer": "Sample answer: This lecture is about New Zealand's super diverse future. 44 percent of the population are not born in the New Zealand, and this number is almost the double of the number of the academical definition. The mega-trend is demography and ethnicity. The benefits from super-diversity increase New Zealand's financial capital, whereas the most of the challenges of super-diversity adversely affect New Zealand's social capital. (70 words)",
    "passage": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fwp4W9lHdE  [5:50-7.26]\nThis is my next contribution to New Zealand's super diverse future. The status quo is not sustainable. Superdiversity stocktake. What I would talk to you about now is designed to help us to adapt to a super diverse New Zealand. To make sure that we are fit for the future. Because New Zealand is super diverse right now. Predominantly in Auckland, but actually throughout New Zealand. Here, we are already 50 percent Maori, Pacifican and Asian. 44 percent are not born in the New Zealand. And we have over two hundred ethnicities. Now the definition academically of super-diversity is 25 percent are born in New Zealand a hundred ethnicities. So we are almost double that number already. And Auckland will continue to become younger and browner as Angela-saxon population ages and shrinks. So the megatrend here is not age. And the megatrend here is not urbanization. The megatrend is demography. It's ethnicity. And we need to get our head around that because most of the benefits from super-diversity that we, as a country, are enjoying at the moment such as great renovation, productivity and investment increase New Zealand's financial capital, whereas the most of the challenges from super-diversity adversely affect New Zealand's social capital. However, if you don't mitigate the challenges to your social capital, you are not gonna maximize sustainably the diversity dividing benefits for your financial capital.\n",

I want to talk about what I do as a curator and then from that also talk a little bit about the kinds of history that I think museums are particularly good at creating and communicating. I think this is something I'd really like to discuss because I think it's not necessarily very well understood that museums as Dave insisted by putting up my quote in his slide, is that I think museums create a very particular kind of history. It's not the kind of history that gets created in books or in dating films or in compositions, it's a very particular kind of history that grows out of the fact that museums are centrally interested and defined by their collections. I should say that's not an uncontested view of museums but it's certainly my view of museums.\n[05:28 - 06:33]\nSo curators try to understand material culture as evidence of other people's lives as a means to try to understand other people - what they look like, what they did, how they made a living, what they hoped for in their lives, how they tried to construct their world and why they made particular choices. And one way in which curators differ from other historians is therefore in terms of how we interrogate the past, what elements we use to communicate the past. Most academic historians are trained very much in the discipline of words and they concentrate on words still today I think although it's changing a little bit. If you go through university history, I think primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like archival accounts, manuscripts and now oral histories, and most of that work is actually promulgated in the form of books.\nThere are also other kinds of historians.

    "answer": "Sample answer: Instinct is a set of behaviors that are both unlearned and set in motion as the result of some environmental triggers. Firstly, instincts are in relation to motivation. Secondly, instincts are present across species and consistent within individual species. In terms of instinct and a reflex, both are types of unlearned behavior, but a reflex is a simple reaction while an instinct is a complex set of behaviors. (68 words)",
    "passage": "Instinct is a term used to describe a set of behaviors that are both unlearned and set in motion as the result of some environmental trigger. Instincts are also often discussed in relation to motivation since they can also occur in response to an organism's need to satisfy some innate internal drive tied to survival.\nInstincts are present across species and are consistent within individual species. In other words, many different species rely on instincts, and if one member of a species possesses an instinct, then they all do.\nBefore we move into a discussion of specific types of instincts, it is important to distinguish the difference between an instinct and a reflex. Both are types of unlearned behavior that tend to serve a survival purpose. The difference is that a reflex is a typically a simple reaction or a response to an environmental trigger whereas an instinct is a much more complex set of behaviors.\nFor instance, an example of a reflex would be when a baby turns his head toward an object that is pressed against one cheek in an effort to nurse. The head turn is a simple reactionary process. An instinct would be the manner in which a mother bird regurgitates her food to feed her young in response to their signals of hunger. Both are reactions to environmental cues; however, the mother bird must engage in a series of much more complex behaviors in order to respond to the cues the environment is providing her.\n",

    "answer": "Sample answer: The lecture is about a fast radio burst which is a very fast burst of radio waves. It starts and stops quickly, and these bursts are a real mystery because there are many questions about them and we don't have an answer for it. There are many theories on what makes them. Finally, by using a fantastic telescope, we can find these bursts much more quickly. (68 words)",
    "passage": "A fast radio burst is very much like what it sounds. It's a very fast burst of radio waves. It comes from outer space, a long way away. And by fast, I mean really fast. So it starts and stops in about a thousandth of a second, so you click your fingers, and it's finished. Fast radio bursts are a real mystery. We don't exactly understand where they come from, or what actually makes them. And there's a lot of open questions that we really don't have an answer for. There are probably more theories about what makes fast radio bursts, than there are actual detections of these things. So since 2007 we've only had 20, but there are probably 30 or 40 different theories on what makes them. The most interesting thing about this burst is the fact that we found it with the Australian square kilometre ray path finder. So that is, it wasn't really obvious that we would be able to do this, as well as we ended up being able to do it. So this telescope is really a fantastic telescope. \nIn fact it's probably the best telescope on the planet at the moment for finding these bursts. So whereas in the past it's taken ten years to find twenty bursts, once we're really going with this new instrument, we'll be able to find them much more quickly. One or two every week.\n",

This was a study which was done a few years ago in Trieste which is basically at the border on Slovenia and Italy. So there are a lot of Italians and there are a lot of Slovenians and there are of course a lot of mixed marriages. What they did was they took three groups of babies, all babies were seven months old so there were a bunch of Italian speaking babies, bunch of Slovenian speaking babies and a bunch of Italian-Slovenian babies from mixed families. They showed those babies various puppets and then they switched the situation. Typically when the seven-month-old baby is used to particular setting and the situation switches, it takes them a little while to regroup. So turned out that seven-month-old Italian and seven-month-old Slovenian babies would get used to the puppet appearing on the right, and then when the puppet would appear on the left they would continue looking to the right as if nothing had changed. Whereas the bilingual babies very quickly would turn their head and notice that the puppet has changed its position. So again an indication that all other factors being equal.

In the past, people made judgments about what others wear, but the warmth of clothing and the culture of clothing industry have been ignored for a long period. Overall, food, shelter and clothing can be considered as three basic necessities of human, but clothing industry is the only one we ignored.

So, it can be understood as the integration of economic activities across borders.

    "answer": "Sample answer: Organization studies seem to draw on the whole family of disciplines, such as social science, psychology, sociology, and economics, anthropology, politics. The speaker enjoys studying organization study because of its broad range and its breadth. He also points out that organization studies are actually the artificiality of those academic subdivisions. What organization study has taught him is liberating ideas without strictures and disciplinary boundaries. (64 words)",
    "passage": "Organization studies seem to draw on the whole family of Social Sciences, clearly psychology, clearly sociology, but also economics, anthropology, politics, as we said, philosophy to a degree history sometimes read literary studies, cultural citizen, so on and so forth. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And for me, that's absolutely the pleasure and even on good days, the joy of doing organization studies, because it enables you not just enables, but requires you, in sense, to have some kind of broad familiarization of that sort.\nNow, there's a price to be paid for that because that kind of breadth, if you like, does come, I suppose as the cost of depth And I guess there would be people who are clearly within academic disciplines of sociology or economics or whatever, who might say, well, these are sort of magpie-ish, amateurish kind of forays into our territory. You know, I wouldn't necessarily disown that idea. But I think that what studying organizations teaches us and teaches me is actually the artificiality of those academic subdivisions. As soon as we start, we'll actually think about something like the organized world then immediately, the kinds of things that come into focus are things that have traditionally been studied by different demands. And so, I think it's a liberating idea, the idea that we don't need to be bound by those strictures and structures of disciplinary division, and that we can be free actually to imagine and think about the social world through an agglomeration of techniques and ideas and theories and concepts from across the social sciences.\n",

    "answer": "Sample answer: The view of industrialization as beginning a situation of winners and losers has been rejected, because the Industrial Revolution is measured by more than simply large factories with industrial workers and the number of machines. Moreover, the Industrial Revolution was first and foremost an intensification of forms of production. In general, the rapid rise in industrial production was very tied to traditional forms of production. (65 words)",
    "passage": "Through the 1950s and into the 1960s, the idea of the Industrial Revolution was that it was the work of some genius inventors who created machines used primarily in the textile industry but also in mining that eliminated blocks to assembly line production. Then everybody was crowded into factories and the new brave world opened up. In fact, one of the most interesting books and great classics that is still in print was written by an economic historian at Harvard who's still alive called David Landes. It's a good book called The Unbound Prometheus, which was basically that. Some of the inventions that I briefly describe in your reading, the spinning Jenny, etc, refer to that. Well, and that kind of analysis led one to concentrate on England where the Industrial Revolution began, and to view industrialization as beginning a situation of winners and losers by not going as fast. Now, that analysis has been really rejected greatly over the past years, because Industrial Revolution is measured by more than simply large factories with industrial workers and the number of machines. This is the point of the beginning of this. The more that we look at the Industrial Revolution, the more that we see that the Industrial Revolution was first and foremost an intensification of forms of production, of kinds of production that were already there. And thus, we spend more time looking at, you know, the intensification of artisanal production, craft production, of domestic industry, which we've already mentioned, that is people mostly women but also men and children, too, working in the countryside.

Well, in a sense, you know, we are all children, we stay being children all in our lives. There is no obvious endpoint for learning sounds, of course, there is for learning grammar, there is for vocabulary, huh. I mean that goes on for the rest of our lives in million or more words in English. Most of us only have a vocabulary of 50, 60, 70 thousand words, whatever it is until there is always something to learn.

This changed the way people think about it and led to further studies. Thus, no one now would doubt about child depression, but the way that children show depression is somewhat different, and the responses to medications are different as well, which remains to be resolved.</p>",

It is a guide for the travelling and distant lands and describes his supposed travels to the Mid East, Africa and Asia. Although its descriptions were not true, it only shows how European people thought about foreign lands and civilizations outside Europe, and all these are mysterious, alluring and intimidating, unknown. (67 words)",
    "passage": "But if you were to go to a library at the end of the 1300s, or through the 1400s, you would probably find a book that was then, way more popular than those titles we still read, a book that purported to be a description of the world, a guide for the traveling and distant lands of BC area and Almanac of everything that was just off the horizon. I am not talking about Marco Polo. No, I'm talking about something far far, weirder and far, far less tethered to reality, a volume of medieval fantasy masquerading as a field guide called The travels of Sir John Mandeville, supposedly the titular night set out from England in the 1330s and embarked on a journey that would take him to the Middle East, Africa and Asia, though as it will become apparent, not a Middle East, not in Africa and not an Asia that we would recognize here in reality. No Mandeville spoke is not really about actually real foreign lands. It's about what Europeans thought was just outside the bounds of their civilizations. It's about what's beyond that mountain range that marks the borders of the lands you know. It's about what medieval people thought the foreign looks like.

There is a time when I think companies have many of the adventures in the world. That involves the companies' world. It was the bosses' world. Now I think it reverses the case.

    "answer": "Sample answer: Semantic noise in communication is a type of disturbance in the transmission of a message that interferes with the interpretation due to ambiguity in words, sentences or symbols. However, the ambiguity is caused because everybody sees a different meaning in the same things. The differences in interpretation can be small in communication between people from similar backgrounds or can be different because of the diversity of culture, age or experience. (70 words)",
    "passage": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/semantic-noise-in-communication-definition-examples-quiz.html#lesson \nSemantic noise in communication is a type of disturbance in the transmission of a message that interferes with the interpretation of the message due to ambiguity in words, sentences or symbols used in the transmission of the message.\nLet's take a step back for a moment to provide a larger framework that helps you understand the idea of semantic noise a bit easier. Communication is the process of transmitting information from one person to another. Information is a pattern of data organized in a particular way. For example, a sentence consists of symbols that form words in a particular language with a particular meaning. The sentence also utilizes grammar, which is a recognized way to structure words forming a sentence. Noise is any type of disturbance that interferes with the interpretation of the information. Some argue that noise exists in all communication.\nSemantic noise doesn't involve sound but rather ambiguity in words, sentences or other symbols used in communication. The ambiguity is caused because everybody sees a different meaning in the same words, phrases or sentences.

    "answer": "Sample answer: Recycling water is needed, as we don't generate much new water. So the total volume of water in the world is relative to the rate at which we are using or demanding for fresh water. However, there is little recycling at a local level, for sophisticated process of reusing water is hard to become a close loop. (59 words)",
    "passage": "Why do we need to recycle water? Because we don't generate much new water. Chemically the process of generating water, which is basically taking hydrogen and oxygen and burning them to produce water, is not a process that happens a lot anymore. So in terms of our total volume of water in the world, yes it is changing, but it's not changing significantly relative to the rate at which we are using or demanding fresh new water. Now there are a lot of different areas of technology involved in water recycling, and we are later in the interview going to get to industrial use and the reclamation of sewerage. What about in the home at the moment; what sort of technology is being utilized in the home when we talk about water recycling? Well very little on average. Typically in a modern home, we turn on the tap, we take a glass of water, we probably in turning on that tap flush ten glasses of water down the sink. We take a shower, we use fresh water, we do a whole range of things, and there is nominally very little recycling of that. It goes down the drain and it goes off to a waste water treatment plant. There is actually very, very little recycling at a local level. People don't actually say well I'm now going to take the water I just used, put it through a sophisticated process and reuse it and have a closed loop. It's not a closed loop in the home.\n",

Since they provided some start points, the protections contained within the UN human rights in many ways. Moreover, the convention was devised at the end of the Second World War. Finally, rights sometimes are described as being positive or negative nature, and it follows a baseline or minimum standards for human rights. (68 words)",

At the same time, it can be described as a somewhat cautious document that provides the starting point for a wider application of the law to rights. In many ways, the freedoms and protections contained within the Human Rights Act were not new to people living in the UK. The output of the UK law influenced most of the clauses in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Convention itself was devised following the end of the Second World War by the Council of Europe. UK lawyers played a significant role in the drafting of the convention and the UK was among the first governments to ratify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or negative nature. That's to say some can be expressed as a right to, another's is freedom from. The 1998 Act puts into place 15 specific rights and freedoms which include rights to liberty and security, a free trial, free expression, free elections, and the right to marry and found a family. There are also freedoms from torture, from slavery or forced labor, and from discrimination on grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin.

While many people focus on logic and thinking nature, ignore some basic emotions which have a purpose to help with our self-preservation and safety.

Many of us would prefer to focus on our logical, thinking nature and ignore our sometimes troublesome emotions, but emotions have a purpose.

Hence, <span style=\"color:black;\">to release such stress, people could use a calendar to schedule and find a balance between play and work.</span></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\"><br/><strong>",

    "answer": "Sample answer: 31 obese women volunteered an experiment that tested on body fat changes. They followed strict daily diet requirements and did exercise regularly. After 6 months, some of them lost weight, while others stayed the same and some even gained weight. There are two explanations: some of them may have cheated on the diet, or some of them consciously or unconsciously did less exercise. (63 words)",
    "passage": "近似原文，仅供参考\nI would like to look at a recent survey conducted by Canadian researchers on diet. Total thirty-one women volunteered in the survey. They've been told to participate in the exercise program without changing their diet. After careful observation, the researchers actually found that some volunteers experienced a body fat change after six months from the day they've started the experiment. The finding further stated that some actually lost a significant amount of fat, which led to a decrease in body mass. On the other hand, there were others who did not lose fat at all. So, I guess, the study concludes that there must be two explanations. Those who did not lose weight must have eaten more. And another factor is that it is because there are psychological reasons - not to believe in losing fat. \n",

It is not true to classify humans as plants, trees, flowers or micro-organisms and separate ourselves from animals because people and animals are actually interconnected with each other. And the perspective from the animals' side could help deepen the understanding of animal behaviors and human nature and make it possible for us to know who we are. (68 words)",
    "passage": "原音频: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6gt9iAMebw [00:18 - 01:45]\nFar too many people often say things like animals do this but we don't. Or this animal does this and that animal does this, but the humans don't do things like that. Those statements have some assumptions like we are not animals. When we say animals do this, animals do that, we often assume they are not animals. If we are not animals, what are we? Are we plants or trees or flowers? No, we are not. Then okay we are not plants? And Are we micro-organisms, really tiny microscopic things? No, we are not. Then the natural conclusion must be we are not living things. That's not true. Yes, we are animals and I see animals in us and I see humans in animals. So, I'm going to talk about the animal behaviour and human nature. In order to understand human nature, we can look into animals' eyes and animal behaviours and find something about what made us, who we are.\n",

Researchers find that there are four categories of interactions between babies and their mothers. By studying when and what the subsequent effect was, it's found that mothers want the interaction, while babies want to be smiled at. (65 words)",

Well it turns out those smiles aren't spontaneous - they're strategic.\nResearchers have found that when babies smile, it's for a reason. They want whoever they're interacting with-typically a parent-to smile back. And they time it just so, a smile here and a smile there. The researchers call it sophisticated timing. The study is in the journal PLoS ONE.\nThe researchers enlisted real mothers and infants and quantified their interactions, which fell into four categories. One: babies wanted to maximize the amount of time smiling at their mothers. Two: they wanted to maximize the time the mothers smiled at them. Three: they wanted to experience simultaneous smiling, and four: no smiling at all.\nBy studying when smiles happened and what the subsequent effect was, the investigators were able to figure out that for mothers the goal 70 percent of the time was to be smiling simultaneously- while for babies 80 percent of the time they just wanted their mother smiling at them. So, mothers want the interaction, while babies just want to be smiled at.\nSo your baby may not be able to feed itself, talk or even turn over yet.

So organizations, governments, and individuals consider what we can do. Although the scientist's three-part crisis scenario did not come about, the world cannot take the risk of climate change because eleven of the warmest years occurred in the past twelve years and major precipitation changes are taking place globally. (69 words)",
    "passage": "There can now be no reasonable, science-based, doubt about the reality of global climate change effects brought on by the cumulative and rapidly growing emission of so-called 'greenhouse' gasses - primarily carbon dioxide - into the atmosphere. As these effects become increasingly more obvious worldwide, so commercial interests, groups of concerned individuals and national governments have been gripped by what amounts to mass panic about what to do about it. To many, Paul Ehrlich's Malthusian 'Population Bomb' of 1968 appears about to explode in the world's face in an indirect version of his millenarian vision of population growth which outpaces agricultural production capacity-with predictably catastrophic results for humanity. And his three-part crisis scenario does indeed seem now to be present: a rapid rate of change, A limit of some sort, and delays in perceiving that limit. Ehrlich's work was roundly criticized at the time, and later, from many quarters, and much of what he predicted did not come about. Nevertheless, can the world afford to take the risk that the climate scientists have got it wrong? Is it not in everyone's interests to apply the Precautionary Principle in attempting to avoid the worst of their predictions - now, rather than at some future time? As the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Mr. Rajendra Pachauri, has recently pointed out, eleven of the warmest years since instrumental records began have occurred in the past twelve, while major precipitation changes are taking place on a global scale.\n",

Indeed, the public has the interests in the language itself. Sometimes, people may care about the origin of the towns or babies’ names.

It is so far outside the mindsets of most people that they have difficulty appreciating what the crisis is all about, because they are not used to thinking more about language as an issue in itself. Somehow we need to change these mindsets.\nWe need to get people thinking about language more explicitly, more intimately, more enthusiastically. Interest in language is certainly there, in the general population - most people are fascinated by such topics as where words come from, or what the origin of their town's name is, or whether their baby's name means anything; and they are certainly prepared to play Scrabble and a host of other language games ad infinitum; and language games are often found on radio and television, too - but a willingness to focus that interest on general issues, a preparedness to take on board the emotion and drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment, is not something that happens much.\n",

    "answer": "Sample answer: The lecture is mainly about Australian housing price which is so expensive. The reason is that Australia has experienced uninterrupted economic growth. Meanwhile, the mortgage rate was halved. Moreover, the increasing immigration population and the falling average size of household led to a higher demand for accommodation, but there is not any increase in net supply. The additional purchasing power pushed Australian housing price up.(65 words)",
    "passage": "Well, it's like, why is Australian housing is so expensive? Essentially, it's showing of how well the Australian economy has been doing over the last 15 years. We have had 15 years more or less of an uninterrupted economic growth during which average earning has been raised by close to 90 percent. While over the course of that period, the standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved. That meant that the amount which a typical home buying household can afford to borrow under rules which aren't strictly applied as they used to be had more than doubled. Over the same period, rising immigration in falling average household size has meant that the number of households looking for accommodation has risen by about one and a half million. That's around 200 thousand more than the number of dwellings has increased by. So you have had a substantial increase in the purchasing power of households. No net increase in the supply of housing enhance all that additional purchasing power has gone into pushing up the price of housing.\n",

    "answer": "Sample answer:Globalization has few different definitions. It means the proliferation of transactions across the country. On the one hand, it is the increase of international communications and trades. Countries are less self-sufficient. On the other hand, it is an integrated economic system. We see a global split in the process between consuming and producing goods. One country’s economy depends on others. It is a new area of economic progression. (70 words)",
    "passage": "Globalization, what is globalization? I think that it takes on a few different definitions in one sense of the word. Globalization means proliferation of transactions across country. So, one way of thinking about globalization is a way to describe, increase international communications, more trade happening between countries and be less self-sufficient in providing goods and services to their people and more companies that have offices in multiple countries, which we call multinationals. So, the source of growth in travel and communication and corporate trade across borders. And this way of thinking about globalization is the continuation of thinking that has been around for a long time, such as when the Europeans went to the Orient, to find spices, which was also an example of global trade and communication. Another way to think of globalization though, is an economic system. It is a system in which countries become integrated in a way that had never been before. In this system, we see a global split in the process between consuming and producing goods. Some countries produce goods, some countries consume goods, and then these countries in different areas of the globe depend on each other in a kind of organic solidarity rather than having an economic system being just inside your country. The system is the way economy in your country functions depends on economy of another country. And in fact this way of thinking about globalizations represents a new area of economic progression.

I had an older child and two younger children, twins, is shown in this picture. And one of my children, three years old, shouted. And I've never denied he shouted. He shouted, \"Monster! Monster!\" At this statue, which looked just like a monster. Had snakes for hair, a big beak for a nose. And I thought, this is fantastic. I got a three-year-old that's appreciating prehispanic art. How good can it get? So, I bent down. I said, yes, it looks just like a monster. And at that moment, a security guard came over, then a gallery assistant came over and said, we're being too noisy and threw us out. Roll the family. During that time, I was a journalist with The Guardian newspaper. And two days later, I wrote a big piece in The Guardian about being thrown out of the Royal Academy. And what was really interesting was by the end of that day, at the paper we had over 500 emails from other families saying museums aren't working for us. Let's try and make it work. So that's what we did in the garden. We set up a campaign for the kids' museums campaign. It didn't really exist. It was just a few pages long run, those stories on it. I began touring the country talking about how to make your museum more family friendly.; I was a journalist. I was called in to see the then director of the National Gallery in London, and I'll never forget this moment, when he called me in and said, 'We really like this Kids in Museums campaign, and we've been talking on our board about it, and we have some ideas of how we might work together, and I'd like you to take them back to your team\".",

The second one is the climate change because of the Burning fossil fuels which emits carbon dioxide into the air. The third one is that if a country is out of fuel, which can cause security of supply may be threatened.(69 words)",

When I say we, I'm talking about the so-called developed world. The developed world gets 80 or 90 percent of all its energy from fossil fuels and living on fossil fuels for energy in this way is not sustainable for three fairly obvious reasons. First on the left, easily accessible fossil fuels are a finite resource. And so at some point that resource will be exploited. And humanity will have to do something else. Second, setting fire to fossil fuels puts carbon dioxide upstairs. So we have the climate motivation. The clear consensus of the climate science community is with substantial arable still on exactly what might happen. Their advice is this is a geoengineering experiment that we're well advised to stop as soon as possible. And third, even if you don't believe in climate change and even if global fossil fuels aren't running out today, it might be the case that your fossil fuels or our fossil fuels in a particular country or state have run out. And you might have to depend on other countries or states for fossil fuels in the future. So you have a security of supply motivation for saying, let's look into really getting off fossil fuels in a serious way.

It is less well established in the curriculum than other subjects, and less well taught and some critics have seized on this as a reason for wanting to step back from supporting it.\nYet, the progress made to date by the more committed schools suggests that the reasons for introducing citizenship are both worthwhile and can be fulfilled, given the time and resources. Indeed, those reasons are given added weight by national and global events of the past few months.

However, the view of the universe was completely transformed by Einstein and people began to understand that there was no absolutely fixed stage of space. Moreover, the universe was in the state of continuous dynamic change. Finally, this discovery was not made by Einstein, but fell to the astronomer Edwin Hubble. (59words)",
    "passage": "For thousands of years, philosophers and astronomers and thinkers of all sorts imagined that the universe, the space around us was rather like this floor in front of us. It was fixed and unchangeable, and things happened on it just as people walk around. So, the stars, the comets, and the planets, and the other heavenly bodies moved around and traced out their paths on this completely unchanging stage of space. In the 20thcentury, as a result of Einstein's work, that view of the universe was completely transformed. We began to understand that there was no absolutely fixed stage of space at all on which all the celestial motions were played out. But in some sense, on the largest scales in the universe, space itself was in the state of continuous dynamic change. That was the prediction made by Einstein. But it wasn't Einstein who had the honor of making the discovery that our universe is really like that. That distinction fell to the astronomer Edwin Hubble.\n",

There are some genetic differences in cognitive and physical abilities between present people and our ancestors from 500,000 years ago, whereas there are only a small number of changes in terms of genetic development. Hence, a small number of genes maybe responsible for our powerful mind.（59words）",

As long ago as the reign of Charles II the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of 'sea coal. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by 'self-regulation' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect.\nThe next stage was prompted by the Industrial Revolution with the urbanization of society and its profound effects on the environment. Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximize their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of 'Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good.\nThose industrialists who were concerned for either the health of their employees or the local environment faced higher costs than their competitors.

However, she knew that she couldn't get her current job without her college degree, but the cost has made the payments far exceeded her family income. Hence, her children will have to join the citizens who couldn't rely on their parents for college support. (68 words)",

Fifteen years later, I still experience moments of sheer horror regarding my family's financial situation. My monthly student loan payment is more than triple my car payment. OK, so without my college degree, I would not have been able to get my current job. For that I'm grateful; but at what cost? My loans have been accruing at a rate of 10 percent, and now they have burgeoned to-well, I'm an English major, you do the math. I don't think they'll ever get pay off. We're in debt way past our eyeballs, and there's no hope in sight.

Do I wish I'd chosen another educational route? You bet. Perhaps trade school-I've thought that being a plumber might not be such a bad gig. But if your job aspirations require a four-year degree, take my advice and choose a college you can afford, both during and after graduation. Take a realistic look at your anticipated income, and factor in priorities that don't carry a price-like the spouse and children you might want to have some day.

Cables attach it to generators on the shore. Since the November 2009, it's been powering 9000 homes in the Orkney Islands. Another device looks like a snake. The anaconda is made from a rubber tube filled with water that floats just below the surface. When the swell hits the front of it, the tube squeezed above ripples done its links and power a turbine in its tail. Prototypes are currently being tested, but the full-scale version will be 200 meters long.\nThis system also looks like a snake. But this one is made of steel. It floats near the surface, where waves make its joints move, this drive hydraulic system that power electrical generators, like the anaconda. It's still being tested; results will prove that these devices are up to the job of supplying variable sources of green energy.\nNow many devices are simulating sea creatures. The first device simulates oysters, which float in the sea by using the energy from wave. The second is the anaconda device operating like snakes, which create energy by spraying water in the tube. The third is also based on snakes, but made of steel, creating electrical energy that is a kind of green power.\n",

Scientists are accumulating vast amounts of data about structure and function in a huge array of brains, from the tiniest to our own. Tens of thousands of researchers are devoting massive amounts of time and energy to thinking about what brains do, and astonishing new technology, including computers and artificial intelligence, is enabling us to both describe and manipulate that activity. Humans can tell computers what to do and how to do, by giving the meaning of the certain words. Computers can operate as programed, and develop systems and symbols.
