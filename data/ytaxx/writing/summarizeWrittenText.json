    "answer": "Supporting ideas:\nAgree:\n1. Aircrafts burn finite fossil fuels, and emit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at high altitude, making them particularly harmful to the climate.\n2. It is a risky program with lots of uncertainties.\n\nDisagree:\n1. Air travel allows you to relax more than driving because you don't have to constantly stay alert to avoid an accident.\n2. Flying shortens the travel time to your destination. A longer trip, such as traveling across the country, shrinks from multiple days in the car to just one day of travel on a plane.",

If companies offer excellent pay packages, they can attract the most talented people in their fields to work for them, especially for many world-renowned technology companies, such as Google and Apple.\n4.

Since each student has a preferred and distinct way of learning, the deadline may cause students who work hard but slowly to feel anxious and thus slow down their paces to accomplish the task in turn.\n2. Students may fail to complete the task on time due to some uncontrollable factors, and these students can be given some flexibility in submitting their task, or a negative impact would be exerted on them that they may be less motivated in the future.\n\nRecommendation：\n1.

Economic growth does not necessarily mean we could have a happier life, because many workers have to work overtime, which leads to a stressful lifestyle.\n\nDisagree:\n 1. A strong economy creates jobs, provides opportunities for the government to invest in greater infrastructure and leads to a more advanced country \n2. Measuring national development just by using a happiness scale alone is overly subjective and closed-minded. It only takes into account how people feel rather than how the nation is run.",

It describes the effects that occur when the average age of a country increases. There are two main causesof population ageing: increasing life expectancy and declining birth rates. Currently, the vast majority of countries have an aging population and this trend is expected to accelerate for the remainder of this century.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">Life expectancy is increasing around the world thanks to advances in science and technology which are improving our quality of life. The most impactful developments are in the areas of nutrition and medical science. As a race, humans are healthier than ever before and we have the means of treating many diseases and injuries that would have been fatal in the past. Reduced fertility rates are the result of many different factors such as economic pressures, gender equality and the availability of contraception.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">An ageing population poses a large economic challenge for most countries. Current predictions show that by the end of the century, the earth's population will be in decline. The result of this trend is that each country will be burdened with a large number of senior citizens who are unable to effectively contribute to their national economy. Many countries will be unable to afford the pensions that need to be paid, nor the additional cost and pressures added to existing welfare systems.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">There have been a number of solutions which have been implemented in an attempt to address the issue: Australia has implemented the use of superannuation funds to reducepeople's dependence on pensions after retirement. Furthermore, the age of retirement has also been pushed back to compensate for the longer lifespans. This solution may not be very effective due to the fact that elderly people work less productively. In some countries, governments have also been introducing more \"family friendly\" laws and policies to encourage women to have more children.</p>",

Previously, it was widely believed that human needs and desires outweighed the rights of other living organisms such as animals and nature. It is now evident that this kind of thinking has led to extremely reckless behavior with very little accountability. Animals rights in particular have gained widespread support in Australia and other western countries. If animals have equal rights to humans, then are we entitled to use them for our own benefit? This puts the question to many issues such as inhumane farming practices, animal experimentation and animal abuse.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">There are many farming practices that are now condemned by the general public. Animal rights organisations such as the RSPCA have been campaigning for farming regulations thatminimizes the amount of pain that livestock suffer. They have also been seeking amendments to hunting policies and the establishment of more natural heritage sites. These can be considered practical approaches to protect animal rights which makes concessions towards the realities of the situation. More extreme approaches which have been suggested include the complete cessation of all farming activities and for everyone to convert to vegetarianism.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">Currently, it can be argued that using animals is still very necessary to sustain our lives. Although some practices such as animal experimentation may have horrific consequences on the animals involved, they are generally tolerated because they have the potential to save countless human lives. Other practices such as the consumption of meat are too deeply ingrained in our culture for us to realistically end them. Although most people support animal welfare, the decision to become a vegetarian and to boycott animal products is still considered an individual life choice rather than a social expectation.</p></p>",

There are three main forms of globalisation; economic, cultural and political. Globalisation did not become a big topic of interest until quite recently (The 1970's). The evolution of transport and communications technologies; alongside business and trade relationships have made the nations of the world much closer and more dependent on each other. Part 1 of this series will focus on the economic side of this phenomenon.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">Economic globalisation is generally seen as a very positive development. It allows for therapid growth of trade and movement of capital between different nations. In recent years, many countries have established trade agreements in order to reduce taxes and tariffs on goods entering and leaving their borders. There is a lot of incentive for richer countries to integrate with developing nations in order to utilise their industrial capacity. China is the perfect example of this. In the last few decades, China's economy has grown exponentially due to exposure to the international market. Research has shown that this is particularly profitable for developing nations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">There are some drawbacks to economic globalisation. Many large corporations have been criticized for exploiting cheap labour. Although developing nations benefit greatly from this practice, local economies suffer since jobs are being outsourced to other countries. This leads to economic stagnation for countries such as Great Britain and the United States. In some situations, big companies will even take advantage of the lack of laws and regulations in developing nations. This often leads to unethical working practices and standards such as child labour in Malaysian sweatshops.</p>",

Humanity has only just recently developed a sense of responsibility for nature. Animal protection programs are the direct result of this newfound responsibility and they are primarily conducted by our zoos and wildlife reserves.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">Some people do not believe that we have any duty to preserve biodiversity. Darwin's laws of evolution and his principle of \"survival of the fittest\" state that extinction is the natural result of being unable to adapt. However, human activity in the past two centuries have accelerated the change of global conditions far beyond the natural state. As such, it is important to consider the repercussions of our artificially created conditions and how extinctions can affect our own survival.Humans are very dependent on nature in terms of food, technology and even the air we breathe. If nature loses it balance, the results could trigger a catastrophic chain reaction which wipes out a whole ecosystem. Currently, we consume animals as part of our dietary intake, we use them do develop new medicines and treatments and we are inspired by them when it comes to developing technology. Most of our new tech comes from a process called biomimicry where we borrow the features of natural organisms. Therefore, the loss of a species is a loss for all of humanity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">Zoos and wildlife reserves serve a dual purpose when it comes to preservation: They receive public funding to run preservation and breeding projects; they also function as an educational exhibition to raise awareness for animal protection. There are countless examples of fantastic preservation programs, from pandas in China to polar bears at the south pole. These usually involve a huge amount of effort to construct an artificial environment that simulates their natural habitat where they can be carefully cared for and monitored.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 14pt;\">In terms of education, most zoos will run educational tours for local public schools. The aim of these programs is to teach children an appreciation for wildlife so that they will grow up with a healthy respect for animals. While this is certainly an excellent goal, many critics pointto the fact that the animals exhibited in zoos are being held in captivity and are often trained to do entertaining \"tricks\". This means that kids are being given a very inaccurate impression of what animals are like and how they should be treated. It questions whether domesticating animals is the same as showing them respect. In spite of this, animals at zoos are generally well cared-for and they represent a healthy shift in our environmental consciousness.</p>",

Humans are responsible for preventing damages caused by various activities.\n2. Governments can adopt several strategies by imposing a tax on car users and manufacturers, improving public transport system and educating citizens about birth control in developing countries.\n3.

    "answer": "Supporting ideas\nAgree: 1. Parents have a duty of supervision of their children. To be more specific, it is parent's responsibilities to teach social behaviour to their children and to discipline them because children do not have the sense of good values. For example, parents should teach children not to take anything that does not belong to them.\n2. It is often said that parents are their kids' first teachers. What parents teach is actually done by the children when they are exposed to the social environment. The research shows that a child who was born in an abusive environment is more likely to grow up with the propensity for violence.\n\nDisagree: \n1. The children themselves, rather than their parents, should be more responsible for what they have done. Most of us grow up learning that if things get tough, mom and dad will find a way to bail you out, taking all the pressure off ourselves. This can be truly dangerous, and as a result that children can easily become over dependent.\n2. Whether parents should pay for their children's behaviour depends on the age of their children. If children can fully understand the consequence of their actions, it should be considered as their own decisions and they should be totally responsible for that.",

Therefore, if children can learn the new language at the early age, they can become more competitive in future. \n\nDisagree:\n1.Children are not capable to understand complex structure and grammar of new language. Moreover, in this age, they are more keen to learn and practice their native language. In addition, kids also may confuse the pronunciation of words between different languages.\n2.If we force children to learn new language against their wish then it may possible that they feel pressure of language learning.
