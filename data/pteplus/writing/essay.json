While some people think that animals should not be exploited for greed, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that being the most advanced species, humans can utilize all natural resources. In my opinion, both opinions are reasonable due to the following reasons.\n First and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that animal exploitation has played an instrumental role on account of improving human health and longevity. To be more specific, we have used animals for various purposes ranging from medical science to psychological testing. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, “over 70% of medicines were first conducted on animals such as rats and pigs in the last century”. It is thus clearly shown that the practice of animal exploitation is still vital to the survival of human race.\n However, the fact that such exploitation is not only inhumane but also unsustainable cannot be ignored. This is because over-exploitation of animals has disturbed the ecosystem at various places, rendering them inhospitable. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, some parts of the Himalayas have lost vegetation and witnessed landslides because poachers killed Tigers for money. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that protecting the right of the animals has to be considered a priority in certain regions. \n In a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that animal exploitation is a double-edged sword.

While some people think that applying robots in school is no doubt cost-effective, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that such immature technology in the teaching setting only works for certain groups of people. In my opinion, I believe that the situation is a double-edged sword due to the following reasons.\n First and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that robots have the potential to become part of the educational infrastructure on account of the pressure on teaching budgets. To be specific, schools can save the money by not having to pay or even hire teachers. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, \"75% of middle schools in South Korea, where robots are being used to teach foreign languages, claim a yearly budget-cut of 20%.\" Thus, it is clearly shown that robots are essential for the plausible redistribution of educational\n funds.\n However, current technical limitations cannot be ignored. This is because the limitations on speech recognition and the ability for social interaction confine the role of robots to that of only teaching assistants or tutors. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, speech recognition is still\n insufficiently robust to allow robots to understand spoken utterances from young children. Without doubt, this demonstrates that robots are only effective in the teaching for certain groups of audience.\n In a nutshell, for the aforementioned benefits and potential risk, I wholeheartedly endorse that both advantages and disadvantages of robots in teaching must be fully taken into account.

    "question_answer": "Sample answer\n\nThe controversial topic with respect to the humanities never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that the value of the humanities have long been underappreciated, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that this field of study is worthless. In my opinion, I strongly agree that studies of the humanities are essential to our society due to the purpose of providing knowledge and inspiring creativity.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that learning the humanities brings more benefits than drawbacks on account of the purpose of providing knowledge. To be specific, there is a scope to explore the cultures, traditions, and languages of different countries by studying humanities. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, \"90% of the students in developed countries become better off because they have chosen the humanities as their field of study. Thus, it is clearly shown that the humanities play a pivotal role in equipping students with the knowledge necessary for the development of our society.\n\nFurthermore, the purpose of inspiring creativity also adds weight to my argument. This is because the subjects covered in humanities are based on societal issues, which makes it possible for students to come up with creative solutions when dealing with difficult tasks at school. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, in terms of tackling difficulties at work, 90% of the people who have studies at least one subject in humanities tend to be more creative than those who haven't. Without doubt, it is clearly shown that the humanities can encourage people to do things in creative ways.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that the humanities are academic disciplines that are indispensable to our daily life.",

While some people think that living in the countryside is a much better choice than having a city life; on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I strongly agree that both cities and countries have their advantages due to the following reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that it is beneficial for one to live in the city on account of the well-established infrastructures. To be more specific, Cities always have extremely well-connected transport links, a wide variety of companies that provide different kinds of services and, thus, more job opportunities. For example, a recent article published in The Economist States, 80% percent of the graduates choose to pursue a life in big cities. Thus, it is clearly shown that people who live in the city can enjoy all those benefits brought about by the infrastructures.\n\nHowever, the benefits of living in the countryside cannot be ignored as well. This is because youll be surrounded by miles of greenery and have much cleaner air to breath once you set foot on the land of the countryside. For instance, according to a study conducted by the Hongkong University, over 70% of people living in rural areas lived a longer and happier life than those living in big cities. Without doubt, it is clearly shown that a life in the countryside can also be preferable.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that city life and country life are beneficial for peoples life in different ways.

    "question_answer": "Sample answer\n\nThe controversial topic with respect to the importance of a foreign language never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that artificial intelligence translators are surpassing human translators in their ability to accurately translate a foreign language, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that AI translators are not really superior to human translators and learning a foreign language is still necessary. In my opinion, learning a foreign language could bring huge benefits, due to cognitive benefits and employment benefits. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that being bilingual or multilingual can be beneficial on account of cognitive benefits. This is because people who speak more than one language have improved memory, problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, enhanced concentration, and better listening skills. For example, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, Bilingual students tend to score higher on standardized tests than monolingual students, especially in the areas of vocabulary, reading and math. It is thus clearly shown that the cognitive benefits of learning languages are undeniable. \n\nFurthermore, employment benefits also add weight to my argument. To be more specific, potential employers consider the fluency in a second language as a valuable asset in an employees skill set, as they are able to connect with a broader range of people. For instance, a recent article published in The Economist states, 88% of employers stated that recruiting team members with language skills is important to their organization. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that proficiency in other languages is a vital skill that better prepares people to compete and succeed in the job market. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that learning a second language plays an essential role in peoples lives.",

In my opinion, I strongly believe that childrens life today is harder due to the higher expectations coming from their parents and the pervasive information about violence and crime.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that life is harder for children in the present day on account of the higher expectations coming from their parents.

    "question_answer": "Sample answer\n\nThe controversial topic with respect to a maximum wage never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that it is reasonable and beneficial to limit high salaries, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, salary caps cause more harm than good, due to disincentives and dangerous jobs. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that high levels of compensation are permissible on account of disincentives. Although the potential positive impacts of a maximum wage, such as equality and reduced costs, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that limiting payment for continued work will directly impact inventors and creators because there is no incentive to work harder if they are already maxed out in pay. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of employees are motivated by higher salary and compensation. It is thus clearly shown that it is unnecessary to limit payment. \n\nFurthermore, dangerous jobs also add weight to my argument. This is because considerable risks of life and limbs make a higher paycheck reasonable. For instance, athletic careers offer little stability and are often short-lived. The job is to exercise and physically compete on a regular basis, so the body is bound to get run down. According to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, more than half of the injuries reported by athletes are sprains, strains and tears. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that those who compete in sporting events face a risk of serious injury and therefore athletes deserve a high salary. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that a maximum wage could have adverse impacts on workers.",

    "question_answer": "Sample answer\n\nThe controversial topic with respect to the study of a foreign language never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that language-learning brings practical advantages, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that studying foreign languages in school is a waste of time. In my opinion, a second language plays an essential role in ones life, due to tertiary entrance and employment benefits. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that learning a second language should be required on account of chances of tertiary entrance. Although the potential negative impacts of mandatory learning should be taken into consideration, such as added academic load and difficulty, I still maintain that studying a foreign language can put students in a more favourable position when they apply for a tertiary course, particularly in disciplines such as humanities, communications and business. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of Australian universities recognise the benefits of language study and are willing to offer those students bonus points during application. It is thus clearly shown that learning a second language can boost chances of tertiary entrance. \n\nFurthermore, employment benefits also add weight to my argument. This is because the job market is much stronger for individuals who speak other languages. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, demand for bilingual workers in Australia more than doubled over the past five years. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that learning a second language enables job hunters to be more competitive in a job interview. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that foreign language learning should be strongly recommended.",

While some people think that young people should be allowed to do things like driving or smoking without limit; on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that age restrictions bring more benefits than harms. In my opinion, it is necessary to impose age restrictions on things like driving and smoking because this will keep children and young people healthy and is beneficial for their personal development.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that age restrictions have more boons than banes on account of their personal health. To be more specific, people who drink or smoke at a young age may lead to bad health conditions. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 40% of the people who had smoked during their adolescence got lung cancer in their forties or fifties. It is thus clearly shown that young people should be guided by age limits if they want to do things that could cause potential detriments to their health.\n\nFurthermore, young peoples personal development also adds weight to my argument. This is because it is quite easy for young people to develop bad habits like drinking and smoking if they are exposed to those actions without limits. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, over 50% of the teenagers who have a father who often drink at home became drinkers before they are allowed to do so. Without doubt, this demonstrates that age restrictions play a pivotal role in young peoples personal development. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that young people should be restricted on certain things until they reach a certain age.",

While some people think that workers will spend less hours on work in the future, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, working hours will be steadily falling, due to following reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that shortened working hours will be promoted on account of work-life balance considerations. To be more specific, an increasing number of workers pay more attention to their personal life as well as physical and mental health because working overtime at workplace could always lead to stress, lifestyle diseases and an unhealthy relationship with family members. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 95% of workers say work-life balance is an essential factor when searching for a new job. It is thus clearly shown that a shift in employees demand for greater balance between their career and personal life could lead to less working hours in the future.\n\nFurthermore, the productivity effects of working time also add weight to my argument. This is because the law of diminishing marginal returns states that working more hours can be counterproductive, which means longer working hours does not necessarily mean higher total output or higher productivity. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, output will be reduced by 58% due to fatigue-induced lower marginal productivity at the end of longer work days. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that there is an optimal level of working hours beyond which a worker's marginal production falls.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that long working hours will no longer be adopted.",

While some people think that it is necessary to regulate student attire, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that free dress should be promoted in schools. In my opinion, a school uniform policy is highly desirable, due to following reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that school uniforms could be beneficial on account of school safety. Although the potential negative impacts of a tight school uniform policy, such as violating a students right to freedom and additional expenses for poor families, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that school uniforms can make campuses safer by preventing gangs from forming on campus and identifying intruders. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of teachers believe that uniforms would be a great help to notice their students when they are out on a field trip. It is thus clearly shown that uniforms develop a secure environment for students.\n\nFurthermore, reducing distractions also adds weight to my argument. This is because the social stress of what students wear to school is gone, so students can focus on academic achievement and test scores. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 76% of students have concentrated more on their academic and co-curricular activities since there is a rule of fixed length skirts and shorts. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that uniforms facilitate an environment where students focus more on their academics.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that standardized dress should be promoted in schools.

    "question_text": "Unemployment among young people is a serious problem. Some people suggest that we can shorten the working weeks for young people. In your opinion, what are both the advantages and disadvantages, and whether it just applies to young people or the whole workforce?",
    "question_answer": "Sample answer\n\nThe controversial topic with respect to unemployment never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that reducing working weeks is a preferable solution to this problem; on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that unemployment can never be solved by such a simple solution. In my opinion, shorter working weeks has both advantages and disadvantages, due to the following reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that reducing working weeks has more boons than banes on account of the fact that this can make all employees in a certain company less stressful. To be more specific, with the total amount of works unchanged, less working weeks means more employees are needed to finish them so that everyone has less work to do. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of the employees, though earning less money than before, are more satisfied with their work after their working weeks have been reduced. It is thus clearly shown that less working weeks brings more benefits than harms in terms of dealing with unemployment.\n\nHowever, the potential risks caused by this suggestion should not be ignored. This is because some competent employees who are capable of dealing with the stress and eager to earn more may feel very unsatisfied if their working weeks, as well as incomes, are reduced for the others. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, 70% of the companies ended up in chaos after their competent employees left for reduced incomes. Without doubt, this demonstrates that this suggestion can also pose great risks on employers.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that reducing working weeks is a double-edged sword in terms of solving unemployment issues.",

It is thus clearly shown that public figures should not give up the right to privacy which is entitled by privacy laws.\n\nHowever, the fact that some stories about the private lives of celebrities belongs to the public should not be ignored. This is because some public figures sell their private stories to the public to generate profit.

    "question_answer": "Sample answer\n\nThe controversial topic with respect to preserving those buildings of the past never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that protecting those buildings is worthwhile; on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that it will cost a fortune. In my opinion, preserving those buildings has more boons than banes because they can serve as places of interest to attract tourists, and maintaining them will be more cost-effective than replacing them with new ones.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that maintaining those beautiful buildings has more benefits than drawbacks on account of their role as cultural relics. To be more specific, the best way to learn the culture and history of a certain place is to visit its cultural relics. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 80% of people who wants to know about the culture and history of Inca ended up visiting the world-renowned Machu Picchu. It is thus clearly shown that the old buildings should be preserved for their cultural and historical values. \n\nFurthermore, the financial reason also adds weight to my argument. This is because removing those old buildings and building new ones there would double or even triple the price of preserving them. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 80% of the governments who chose to maintain old buildings rather than replacing them saved tens of millions of dollars each year. Without doubt, this demonstrates that the old buildings should be protected for their financial values. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that preserving those buildings is preferable. To address this issue, governments should make a concerted effort to make sure those valuable cultural relics are under regular maintenance.",

While some people think that it is highly desirable for high school students to learn ancient plays and works of theatres, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, studying ancient drama has both benefits and drawbacks, due to preserving cultural heritage and misleading information. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable to think that it is an undeniable fact that learning old plays and theatre works can be beneficial on account of saving rituals and heritage. To be more specific, by studying ancient plays, students are able to get a deeper understanding of ancient culture, beliefs, and customs. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, The Persians, a tragedy by an ancient Greek playwright, tells a story that not only has unique and interesting plots, but also teaches a moral lesson. It is thus clearly shown that our ancient rites can be passed on from generation to generation through the introduction of historic dramas. \n\nHowever, the problem of misleading information in old plays cannot be ignored. This is because ancient tragic, comic and romantic plays can deliver wrong information and distract young minds. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, the ancient conservative thinking regarding women in old plays could always lead to gender discrimination of youngsters. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that the bad impacts of these literary pieces cannot be ignored. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that studying ancient plays and works of theatres can play a vital role in high school students education.

While some people think that smartphones bring huge benefits, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that the importance of smartphones is overrated. In my opinion, both opinions are reasonable due to functional apps and social isolation.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that smartphones play a crucial role in modern society on account of a wide variety of useful apps. To be specific, Twitter and Facebook make communication easier; Google Maps enable drivers to get to their destinations and avoid traffic jams. Moreover, people can have access to their information and files by using online storage apps such as Google Drive and Dropbox.

Although other factors leading to Zuckerbergs success, such as a determined mind and a well-educated family, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that his studies at Harvard University had tremendously enriched his life in various ways. For example, during his commencement speech at Harvard, Mark said My favorite lecture was Computer Science 121 with incredible Harry Lewis, and the inspiration of launching Facebook is to connect the Harvard community. Thus, it is clearly shown that Harvard University matters a lot to Mark Zuckerbergs success.\n\nFurthermore, the developed economy also adds weight to my argument. This is because the USA is the worlds technological leader, and such an innovative and high-tech country is what enabled Zuckerberg to experience computer programming at an early age, and cultivated his interests in further study.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to the balance between work and personal life never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that it is essential to keep a balance between work and life, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that work is crucial for better living standards. In my opinion, I strongly believe that maintaining a work-life balance is important but potential obstacles need to be taken into consideration.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that work is as important as personal life on account of physical and mental health. To be specific, working overtime at workplace could lead to exhaustion, stress, and lifestyle diseases. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 64% of employees in China constantly skip breakfast and keep working until midnight, which could lead to obesity, diabetes and even cancers. Thus, it is clearly shown that a balance is essential to staying healthy.\n\nHowever, the intense competition in a job market cannot be ignored. This is because human beings are required to have the knowledge and skills to adapt to the fast-changing workplace and the world. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 78% of people in Australia admit that they care about their career more than their family. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that thriving in a career needs an enormous amount of time and effort because of high competition.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that it is increasingly more difficult to find the right balance between work and other aspects of one's life; however, one should still make efforts to do so, as it is still crucial for maintaining physical health and wellbeing.",

While some people think that governments should put an emphasis on global warming, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that epidemics should be taken into consideration. In my opinion, global warming is the most important issue, and the solutions should also be discussed. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that global warming is a major problem on account of the loss of human beings habitats. To be more specific, global warming leads to the melting of glaciers. As a result, some low-altitude countries will be submerged because of the rising sea level. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Up to 80% of the glaciers in Greenland Island have melted, so the land of Bangladesh has been submerged by 37 percent until 2019, which is a huge loss of human beings` habitats. It is thus clearly shown that global warming is the most pressing concern. \n\nIn addition, the solutions should also be discussed. This includes tightening regulations on gas emissions. To be more specific, governments can levy a carbon tax on corporations and factories, so that they will pay more attention to controlling and reducing the amount of greenhouse gases they emit. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, countries that implemented carbon tax policies last year had already seen a 20% decrease in their emissions. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that such a method could play a vital role in saving the planet. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that concerns about global warming are pervasive, so governments should make efforts to mitigate global warming.",

Thus, it is clearly shown that mass media has a key in affecting people, especially younger audiences.\n\nFurthermore, the immature nature of teenagers also adds weight to my argument. This is because they are too young to be determined about their beliefs. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, 80% of the tested students who are exposed to a TV program displaying the importance of science expressed their willingness to become a scientist after the test. Without doubt, it is clearly shown that the mass media is capable of shaping students opinions.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned young peoples using mass media as the main source of information and immaturity, I wholeheartedly endorse that the mass media has a great influence on people, particularly the younger generation. To address this issue, governments and societies should make a concerted effort to manage mass media content appropriately.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to television never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that television is a medium for disseminating news and information, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that television acts like a companion. In my opinion, both views are valid by taking the wide variety of channels into account.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that television plays an essential role in getting the latest news as well as learning things on account of a wide range of channels. To be specific, BBC or CNN are channels that not only provide latest local news, but also 24/7 news from countries around the world. Meanwhile, other educational channels also count. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, National Geographic, Food Network, Travel, and Discovery channels are becoming far more popular these days among Americans. Thus, it is clearly shown that an individual gets enlightened by watching news or educational channels.\n\nHowever, the source of entertainment cannot be ignored. This is because a majority of people watch television in their free time at night after a long busy working day and it helps them relax and relieve the feeling of loneliness. Sports channel, drama and movie programs are good examples. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 95% of citizens in Australia believed that television is a true companion during lockdown periods due to COVID-19. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that television has become an indispensable part of life for many people in terms of entertainment.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that the benefits of television are indeed too great to ignore.",

While some people think that students should pay the costs as they would secure high-salary jobs after graduation, on the other end of the spectrum, others have assigned the responsibility to the government. Having always believed that society shares the benefits of college higher education, I tend to be the opponent regarding this issue due to financial and social reasons. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that having students pay all the costs is burdensome on account of economic reasons. Granted that its pivotal to be aware of potentially positive impacts of letting students pay the full cost for university, I still maintain that paying the total amount of tuition fees has tremendously harmed students lives in various ways. For example, a renowned American writer Mark Twain once said, High financial burden cause students to struggle with debt.

Having always believed that there are tangible benefits in participating in well-run after-school programs, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue due to students academic performance and social competence.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that after-school activities are useful on account of better academic performance.

While some people are indifferent to fares and favor enhanced public transport services, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that a cheaper public transport is what they desired.

Granted that its pivotal to be aware of potentially negative impacts of making public transport cheaper, I still maintain that an easily accessed public transit has tremendously enriched peoples lives in various ways. For example, a renowned American writer Mark Twain once said, if you have reliable access to public transit, you can save over $10,000 per year on transportation costs. It is thus clearly shown that public transportation with less cost can promote peoples sustainable lifestyles.\n\nFurthermore, the environmental reason also adds weight to my argument.

While some people think that lifestyles are personal, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that government plays an important role, and intervention is needed.

Conventional wisdom has it that ultimately, the aim of developing a good society is to have healthy citizens. For instance, findings of recent research conducted at the University of Melbourne revealed that.

While some people think that people should have the freedom of getting married, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that a wise man should never make such a choice without the ability to undertake it. In my opinion, I strongly agree that this is not a good choice because it will be a huge distraction to students and bring about huge financial burdens.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that young adults should not get married too early due to their academic development. Although the positive impacts of this choice should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that getting married this way can tremendously harm peoples lives in various ways. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Most married students who are often distracted by marriage issues tend to have a poor academic performance at school. Thus, it is clearly shown that getting married after graduation is a better choice.\n\nFurthermore, the financial issues also adds weight to my argument. This is because sustaining a marriage will cost a fortune, which will be a huge burden for students. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, 85% of the students are still receiving financial aids from their families, and thus unable to pay for the costs generated by a marriage.

In my opinion, I strongly agree that the information revolution is a double-edged sword because it brings both convenience and chaos to the society\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that this revolution has positively changed peoples lives due to the conveniences and efficiencies. To be more specific, modern mass media has expanded the channels, methods and speeds with which people can access and exchange information. For example, a recent article published in The Economist States, 80% of people who embraced present-day communication methods, such as social-networking websites, are more closely connected to each other, and could even complete their work faster than before. Thus, it is clearly shown that the revolution can make daily life and work more convenient and efficient.\n\nHowever, the chaos caused by information on mass media cannot be ignored. This is because wider communication also increased exposure to negativity. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, 85% of subjects who often use social networks are extremely prone to being affected by the negativity online, and thus resort to violence in real life, or suffer from depression. Without doubt, it is clearly shown that technological innovations can have negative effects, and may not always result in happiness. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned positive and negative impacts, I wholeheartedly endorse that information revolution by modern mass media have both positive and negative impacts.",

While some people think that it is not really necessary to pursue education overseas, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that studying abroad brings enormous value. In my opinion, I strongly agree that studying abroad may be one of the most beneficial experiences because this experience can provide us with the access to top quality education and more career opportunities.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that studying abroad plays a pivotal role in students academic development due to the higher quality of universities abroad. Although the potential negative impacts of overseas education should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that the experiences abroad have enriched students lives in various ways. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, The average quality of international education programs is 60% higher than local courses. Thus, it is clearly shown that studying abroad is preferable in terms of getting qualified education.\n\nFurthermore, better career prospects also add weight to my argument. This is because, in a globalised, well-connected world, employers increasingly value graduates with international experience and education. For instance, according to a study conducted by HKU, the average income of people who have a degree acquired overseas is 20% higher than those who only studied locally. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that overseas students are better prepared for the world in the process of globalization.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned qualified education and greater job opportunities, I wholeheartedly endorse that studying overseas is definitely not overstated.

    "question_answer": "Some people are of the view that TV, radio, and newspaper have become an essential part of our lives. Though there are some people, who reject this notion and argue. In recent years, the mass media has a significant impact on peoples view and opinions that are already established. The substantial influence of the mass media has sparked debate over the internet. In my opinion, mass media including e-mail and blogs influence the public in more of negative way. This essay will further present this view and thus will lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nThere are myriad of points to explain the influence of mass media on our lives and the most preponderant is shaping the general public views on various news agendas. Mass media is often used by agencies and media houses to convince their audience through advertisements, discussions, news or shows. It takes advantage of the vulnerability of their target audience and convinces them to act in a certain way.\n\nTV shows and movies based on social issues mislead its viewers and public from the real picture. Such programs share thoughts with an opinionated perspective which in turn provoke criticism. It influences peoples opinion in both positive and negative ways. The young people spend an average of 4 to 5 hours in front of screens of their laptops, smartphones, and TV. Sometimes they are feed with unwanted information, disturbing images of violence and other related issues causing extreme pressure on young minds. This lead to youngsters to do misbehavior or sometimes go against the law.\n\nAccording to the argument aforementioned above, the mass media have become the essential part, and its influence on our lives is ever growing and getting stronger as time passes.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether marketing for consumer goods companies like clothing and food should focus on reputation never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that building reputation is better in the long run, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that short-term promotions are more effective at boosting sales. In my opinion, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue due to the following reasons. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that a strong reputation is most important on account of building a loyal customer base. Although the potential positive impacts of special offers and discounts, such as a spike in new consumers, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that the name of having consistent quality has tremendously increased businesses long-term success. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Businesses whose products and services are known to revolve around reputation and customer satisfaction, end up with more loyal customers with repeated purchases, and therefore a stable source of revenue. It is thus clearly shown that being viewed as a trusted brand is key to long-term stability. \n\nFurthermore, the increased prospects also add weight to my argument. This is because recognition of a business tends to apply to everything they provide. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by Hong Kong University, when purchasing a new type of product on the market for the first time, consumers are likely to try out the brand that they know and trust first. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that brand image can create higher chances of success in new areas or markets too. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that marketing should focus on creating a strong reputation.",

    "question_answer": "Since ages, humankind is at war with each other owing to opposing ideas, ideologies, and beliefs. A famous quote In a war of ideas, it is people who get killed comes true when an ordinary man and his family suffer because of ideological conflict. I support this statement. This essay focuses on the effect of a groups ideology on the common man.\n\nThe War of Ideas is a clash of opposing ideas, ideologies, or concepts through which groups use strategic influence to promote their interests abroad. In this war of ideas, it is the common man and his family who suffers the most. They have to live in constant fear of losing their family, livelihood, money, resources and most importantly, loss of life.\n\nPolitical war is a perfect example to support my view. The ruling government uses a variety of techniques to weaken or destroy an opponents political, social, or societal will. In many cases, political war is combined with violence which causes a significant loss to ordinary people or with wrong decisions by government.\n\nThe collapse of Hosni Mubaraks government in Egypt provides relevant examples, as neither likely would have happened absent the popular revolt. The anti-government protest is followed by a series of attacks on Christians and churches which killed many people and many were forcibly evicted from their homes making them live in constant fear. This would not have happened if the difference in political and religious streams of thought did not exist in the Arab worlds most populous country.\n\nTo conclude, it is right to say that people get killed where the conflict in ideas exist. Everyones welfare should be considered before holding on any plan.",

    "question_answer": "Some people prefer following the same routine everyday like eating the same food for breakfast, reading books at a particular time and likewise. From TV stars to supermodels, a solid daily routine is a key to success. I would avoid being repetitive in my daily life and avoid following a course of action.\n\nRepetitive behaviors or routines are essential to many active people as it allows better control of everyday life or a process, but consequently, it restricts the minds ability to improve beyond certain limits. Acting or behaving in a limited framework makes the person lazy as it causes us to lose our interest in adopting new habits. When anyone locks oneself in a pattern or routine, he/she refuses to change.\n\nMany experts believe that changing a routine or moving between two activities, can be distressing for some people and it significantly increased their refusal of the challenge. What I find is, avoiding routine can have numerous benefits on the well-being of the mind and overall personality of the individual. When we shake up the routine, we opt to do one thing differently. For the right reasons, sometimes a different perspective is all we need to change the particular process or situation. By restricting my freedom of action, I do not want to restrict my mind from enriching the knowledge base.\n\nFor example, every day I listen to music from different genres to diversify my experience of music and to stimulate my mind. To conclude, though routine offers a sense of security by constructing a comfort zone, I like to challenge personal stabilization and ask for unusual experience in my daily life.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to new inventions such as smartphones never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that smartphones bring huge benefits, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that the importance of smartphones is overrated. In my opinion, both opinions are reasonable due to functional apps and social isolation.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that smartphones play a crucial role in modern society on account of a wide variety of useful apps. To be specific, Twitter and Facebook make communication easier; Google Maps enable drivers to get to their destinations and avoid traffic jams. Moreover, people can have access to their information and files by using online storage apps such as Google Drive and Dropbox. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Australians spend over 4 hours per day on their smartphones. Thus, it is clearly shown that smartphones have become an indispensable part of life.\n\nHowever, the negative consequences of smartphones such as social isolation cannot be ignored. This is because phones can be addictive, and spending too much time on them can make people socially isolated from the real world. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 46% of adolescents in Australia who are using smartphones in large amounts have been less sociable and less active. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that the widespread use of communications apps and social media on phones has adversely affected ones ability to converse in real life.  \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that the smartphone is a double-edged sword. To address this, governments and societies should make a concerted effort to find a balance.",

    "question_answer": "In the contemporary world, an ethical and business competition between the digital and print media is quite visible. The future of print media in the digital era is a debatable issue. Though some people hold the opinion that the popularity of printed newspaper will exist in the forthcoming days, my two cents is this print news portal will soon disappear to make way for the digital form of getting news.\n\nOne apparent reason for my viewpoint is that online portals and e-newspapers are gaining broad acceptance by its sophisticated features such as clarity, video sharing, social sharing, and instant opinion sharing tools. Over and above, the public goes by online news portals than print versions to get immediate and breaking news. The vast popularity of online editions of the newspapers is the best epitome. When an Internet user can browse virtually any newspaper in the world for free, why should he spend money on reading only a particular newspaper which does not have last hour breaking news?\n\nSome would argue that there is a different appeal to holding a printed newspaper than reading on the computer screen. Thats true, but they should compare the old way of sending letters to the latest email technology. The number of emails people send on an average is million times higher than the traditional postal mails and similarly, reading a newspaper would become a tradition of the past while online news portals would dominate the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the newspaper will soon get its place in history. We can expect many new trends in future not only in the case of the newspaper but also in other printed media, and that is obvious with the widespread acceptance of technology and its popularity among the young generation.",

    "question_answer": "Many times people think why we are spending so much on space travel when we have so many problems here that need to be addressed now. Here in this essay, I am discussing both sides of space travel versus current crucial issues faced by the human.\n\nExploration, being an important survival strategy helps in evolution. The ever-growing Worlds population and the pressure to feed it may be forcing humans to look out for new food sources. The environmental changes, climate change, and other factors are causing humans to seek safe habitats. According to me, these might be the reasons why space travels interest so much to us.\n\nSpace travel is allowing us to explore outside earth surroundings and get a better insight into the world we are living in. By knowing our surrounding in minute details, scientists are trying to find a possible solution to current crucial problems faced by us. The advanced prediction of weather and natural disasters are significant achievements in space exploration.\n\nOn the other hand spending so much on space travel seems wastage when people here on earth are in dire need of it. Natural resource depletion, global warming, ocean acidification and changing weather patterns require our immediate attention. The launch of a space shuttle is millions of dollar. For example, The MESSENGER mission costs $280 million. This considerable expenditure done on space exploration programs can, in turn, be utilized to enrich lives here.\n\nTo conclude, sending people outside the planet may be the best way to persuade people to save planet earth. Money alone cant resolve all our problems.",

There are some analysts hold an opinion that the public schools are better places to advertise to increase the funds for the schools, while others consider that it will cause to children to be exploited it will make them as captive audiences. That essay will assertion both side of the contentions before deducing a reasonable conclusion.\n\nMany people speak not to place advertisements to increase funds in public schools. First and foremost, troubled juveniles could be a significant factor. It is generally seen that when companies place the substantial colorful advertisement in school, children would more focus on advertisement and they would put less concentrate on studies. For instance, the majority of the businesses are placing advertisements in schools to focus more students attraction for their products. Therefore, if pupils do not have enough money to fulfill their requirements, they might get involved in some criminals activities.\n\nSome groups are in favor of placing advertisements to increase fund in public schools in spite of views discussed above regarding not to placing advertisements in public school. An increasing number of facilities could be a substantial reason behind the opponent's viewpoint. Nowadays, businesses spent thousands of dollars on reaching their competitive market. Therefore, if they can place advertisements in the right place, they would pay more than usual, for example, sponsoring for new buildings and equipment.\n\nIn last, undoubtedly, whether placing advertisements in public school or not is always a matter of discussion; however, as far as I am concerned, advertisements should be banned in the school environment and we should make better and serene environment for kids in schools.",

    "question_answer": "Beautiful architectures and monuments often add to the appearance of the city and improve its aesthetic value. Further, if the site has some significant historical event associated with it, then it becomes further imperative to preserve such a landmark.

Lives of such vital structures can be increased and even the action of natural elements revered if timely repairs and reconstructions are undertaken as soon as the need arises. In my opinion, such beautiful structures that are a part of the citys heritage should be preserved to allow the new generations to connect with the citys cultural past.\n\nThe repairs and preservation come at a cost which grows exponentially year over year. The real question that we need to ask is, who should bear this ever-increasing price? Firstly, whatever is good for the society, such as the monuments in question, should be taken care of by the people or their representatives. Who represents the people of a particular place better than its elected government? Therefore, the government should direct funds explicitly aimed at preserving and uplifting the state of these beautiful historic structures. Secondly, if the building already forms a part of some private property, then the government should direct the funds to the owner of the same. Further, to prevent misuse of the funds, the government should appoint a committee to oversee the appropriation of the funds.\n\nIn conclusion, beautiful historical buildings must be preserved to safeguard the cultural heritage of our cities, and the cost associated with repairs and preservation should come from the government.",

    "question_answer": "The topic of compulsory voting in a democratic society as prevalent in over twenty nations is undeniably a controversial topic. Under the mandatory voting system, the eligible citizens, often starting at age 18 register for and participate in the democratic election of representatives. While many disagree with the notion of compulsory voting, I am in favor of it.\n\nThe practice of compulsory voting results in higher voter turnout and produce governments with more stability, legitimacy and a genuine mandate to govern. The most beneficial aspect of it is an informed citizen, an enhanced caliber of representatives and better decisions. The system as a whole not only benefits offices and also helps all individuals.\n\nFor instance, one of the most well-known compulsory voting systems is in Australia. Before the 1924 compulsory voting law, the voter turnout was as low as 47% which soon jumped to between 91% and 96%. Some people perceived advantages to mandatory voting are the stimulation of broader interest politics, as a sort of civic education and political stimulation, which creates a better-informed population. In Australis, the voters who do not turn up could face a moderate fine while, in some countries like Belgium, the voters who dont turn up could face prosecution or harsh punitive action.\n\nIn a nutshell, it is saying that a mandatory voting system in a democratic society is beneficial. However, its implication in a friendly manner is of vital importance. Like compulsory education, voting should also make mandatory for a democracy to be a democracy.",

    "question_answer": "The packaging of products serves many functions. The foremost is to make things easy to carry by the end-user. Although the packaging is essential to make things more convenient, sometimes the consumer gets annoyed by the over-packing of products. I am of the view that consumer should avoid over packed products as often it is purely marketing. In this article, I will further explain my viewpoint with an example.\n\nRecently I visited a supermarket to find plastic-wrapped bananas. In my view bananas already come with their natural, biodegradable cover so what is the need for this extra packaging. When I inquired from the companys customer service, they reverted that it keeps bananas fresh for long. I feel this excess plastic packaging makes the company eligible to charge more for the same fruit.\n\nSimply put, some products are unnecessarily over packed to make more money from the consumer. Also, some products cover is specially designed to give the false perception of higher value to the consumer. The consumer should avoid buying products that tend to be over packed.\n\nInstead, we can always carry our bag to the supermarket to buy regular grocery or fruits to the home. If a consumer feels like any product is over-packed, then he/she can replace the product with another comparable brand or company. This way we can show our support to brand/company opting for less packaging or go-green plan.\n\nTo conclude, we should always opt for minimal, fully recyclable and compostable packaging.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether extreme or adventure sports have advantages or disadvantages never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that extreme sports offer the freedom of physically and psychologically challenging yourself to perform feats that may make other athletes queasy, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that many extreme sports have an element of danger beyond the risks associated with traditional sports. In my opinion, I strongly believe that these kinds of sports are a double-edged sword, because they provide us with thrilling experiences as well as risks.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that it is beneficial to do extreme sports on account of the thrilling experiences. Although the potential negative impacts of this kind of sports should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that doing extreme sports has tremendously enriched peoples lives in various ways. For example, a recent article published in The Economist States, Pursuing adventure and excitement is the key to maintaining psychological satisfaction. Thus, it is clearly shown that doing extreme sports can help individuals add excitement to their lives.\n\nHowever, the high degree of risks cannot be ignored. This is because those who participate in extreme sports, such as bungee-jumping, extreme skiing and sky-diving, risk broken bones, head trauma and even death. For instance, according to a study conducted by the Hongkong University, 38% of the extreme sports athletes died or suffered from serious injuries last year. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that engagement in extreme or adventure sports involves a high degree of risks.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned thrill and high degree of risks, I wholeheartedly endorse that there are both advantages and disadvantages in doing extreme or adventure sports.",

    "question_answer": "Law, in general, is written rules and regulations that are meant for individuals or groups of the society. Law was created, and intended, to guide and shape behavior. I believe law affects peoples behavior. The punishment or reward associated with law causes people to change their behavior.\n\nLaw is for the betterment of society and individuals. The consequences of obeying or disobeying laws impacts people in their everyday lives. Thereby, the law influences how people behave with others in society. Breaking the law would mean trouble. This fear of consequences makes people behave in both their social and professional capacities. For example, earlier male homosexual acts were a crime in many nations, and now with advancement in law, people are now accepting gay members and open about their sexuality.\n\nMany times, people experience legal problems, and these legal problems can impact negatively on their living areas. The mental harassment can bring considerable adverse consequences like going against the system. On the other hand, the law to ensure womens rights makes the women feel equal and safe in society thus bringing a positive change in their behavior. In this sense, laws do influences people behavior in very significant ways.\n\nIn conclusion, as a result of facing possible penalties, people are forced to behave responsibly and do good to others and society. Obey the law and get the reward. The law continually changes our behavior and perception toward many things in our daily lives consciously and unconsciously.",

    "question_answer": "Throughout the World, everyone sees classroom education and training as the key factors to a good future and hence prosperity. However, with the right amount of motivation and practice, any individual can attain that knowledge that the experts teach in the classroom.\n\nMotivation is what makes all the difference between waking up and going again to bed. In fact, right kind and the right amount of motivation is essential to learning because engaging in education and absorbing knowledge is an active process requiring learners conscious effort. Even the students learning in classrooms need the motivation to pay attention to what their teachers are teaching. What the individual need is to set standards and goals and exert some effort.\n\nFor example, when an individual has a keen interest in learning how computer users interact with computer networks than he/she makes an effort to gain mastery in the IT field. Usually, the things that we enjoy is characterized by high energy, self-determination, and better involvement. The self-motivation dont let the person settle for less and crave for more knowledge through e-learning, books, guidance, and self-practice. As he/she enjoys the learning about IT so returns to the activity voluntarily and try to practice beyond basic skills that are often taught in classrooms bound environment. Choosing and practicing the subject of ones own interest rather than compelled to do it makes all the difference in skilled labors and leaders.\n\nTo conclude, it is nor the teachers neither classrooms but the environment in which the learning takes place. Its ones own individual attributes and motivation that can teach one better than the training given to him in classrooms by teachers.",

While some people think that employees should at least have the right to vote in this process, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that their involvement in the process will lead to bad decision-making. In my opinion, I strongly agree that engaging them in this process is not a wise choice because they will slow down this process and result in negative consequences.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that a wise employer should never let his employees join this process on account of wasting too much time.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to what is the most important invention never fails to attract public attention. Personally speaking, computers are the most important invention of these three, because computers improve relationships and improve people`s mental health.\n\nOn one hand, the first reason for my argument is that computers can be seen as communication technology to strengthen relationships. This is reasonable because computers equipped with tools of online chatting enable people to maximize their communication whenever and wherever people need.  According to a recent research conducted by Monash University, which indicates that 98 percent of International students use Wechat in computers to contact their parents and friends, computers can be seen as communication technology to strengthen relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the second reason for my argument is that playing computer games is an effective way of improving mental wellbeing. This is reasonable because playing computer games could be a way of reducing stress and anxiety, which means playing computer games provide people with an awesome opportunity to relieve their build-up of tension from lives. According to a recent study conducted by Oxford University, 87 percent of depressed patients feel relaxed and get better after playing video games, playing computer games is an effective way of improving mental wellbeing. \n\nIn conclusion, computers are the most important inventions of these three, because computers improve relationships and improve people`s mental health.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to larger malls replacing smaller shops never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that this replacement will cause overcrowding in malls, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that it is a positive change. Having always believed that an expanding range of large malls has more boons than banes, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue due to a more efficient shopping experience and lower product costs.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that larger malls are superior to small shops on account of the one-stop shopping experience. Granted that its pivotal to be aware of potentially negative impacts of big centers, I still maintain that big malls have tremendously enriched peoples lives in various ways. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of people choose to go to shopping centers rather than their local stores because the wider access to products means they can complete more of their purchases in one go, thus saving time. It is hence clearly shown that large shopping centers provide a more efficient way to shop. \n\nFurthermore, the lower product costs also add weight to my argument. Conventional wisdom has it that ultimately the aim of the economy is to make products more affordable and raise standards of living. For instance, findings of recent research conducted at the University of Melbourne revealed that large malls create greater competition between suppliers, which in turn reduces prices of goods. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that large malls generate lower prices and thus increase consumers spending power. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned better experience and lower costs, I wholeheartedly endorse that small shops are gradually replaced by larger malls.",

While some people think that textbooks act as better educational materials than new digital materials, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I strongly believe that both opinions are reasonable due to learning efficiency and eye care.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that digital materials are superior to textbooks on account of learning efficiency. To be more specific, the ease of carrying electronic devices around and its high-tech functions bring higher efficiency and effectiveness. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Users of those high-tech materials have the capability to realise complex operations with a screen touch, making learning process additionally efficient. Thus, it is clearly shown that learning experience and capability would be improved by choosing those digital over paper-based educational materials.\n\nHowever, the merits of books cannot be ignored. This is because traditional materials can avoid technical problems and potential eye strain. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 46% of primary school students in China are wearing glasses due to frequent use of digital devices. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that paper-based textbooks should be taken into consideration as it can prevent myopia.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that both digital and written materials should be recommended.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to tourism in developing countries never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that it is a key source of income and employment, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that tourism can also be a source of problems. In my opinion, I believe that tourism in less developed countries is a double-edged sword, because it brings in money as well as neglect of other forms of income-generation.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that tourism often plays a pivotal role in developing countries on account of the income it can generate. Although the potential negative impacts of tourism should also be taken into consideration, I still maintain that it has tremendously enriched peoples lives in various ways. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, In some countries, over 65% of the revenue was generated by the tourism sector. Thus, it is clearly shown that tourism is indispensable for less-developed countries.\n\nHowever, the overdependence on tourism cannot be ignored. This is because it can leave the country vulnerable to economic ruin in the long run and can contribute to political upheaval or natural disasters. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, 90% of the developing countries that rely heavily on tourism went into economic recession this year due to the widespread impact of the COVID-19. Without doubt, it is clearly shown that lacking forms of income-generation other than tourism can cause serious financial issues and risks.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned financial benefits and potential risk, I wholeheartedly endorse that there both advantages and disadvantages of tourism in developing countries. To address, governments should make an effort to carefully manage the tourism industry in their country.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to advancing medical technologies never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that lifespan extension is a blessing, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that it is a curse. In my opinion, I believe an extended life has more boons than banes, due to the following reasons. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that a longer life is positive, on account of the added time it provides. Although the potential negative impacts of an ageing population, such as increased pressure on governments and medical systems, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that life-extending technologies have tremendously enriched peoples lives in various ways. To be more specific, an extended lifespan not only means staying longer with family, but also more time to fulfill life goals. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Those older than 70 reported feeling more fulfilled in their careers and family life. It is thus clearly shown that an increased lifespan allows greater personal fulfillment. \n\nFurthermore, the contributions to the world also add weight to my argument. This is because with a longer life, scientists can invent more, scholars can write more, and so on. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by Hong Kong University, More than half of new academic research were contributed by those of older ages. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that longevity gives people time to continue contributing their talent and wisdom to the world.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that the higher life expectancy given by medical technologies is a blessing to mankind.

There has been a heated debate on whether cars and aeroplanes are important in modern life. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that these transportation means hold a vital place in this day and age due to the fact that they make our life easier and provide us with a superior living standard. This is because with their efficient transportation capability, not only the productivity and effectiveness of our society are improved, but they provide more choices of consumer goods and allow international trading. To illustrate this, the acceleration of globalisation would be a convincing example. As a result, cars and aeroplanes virtually shrink the world; thus, we can enjoy a higher living standard.\n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact the pollution they cause which contributes to global warming and climate change is alarming and should never be overlooked. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that, aside from transportation, cars and aeroplanes have solved numerous global issues and act like life savers.  That is to say, they can serve as the role of lifesavers to rescue people from danger, transport food and supplies to those who are in need and help to tackle the problem of poverty and hunger.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that cars and aeroplanes are of the utmost importance among the inventions for the last century.

There has been a heated debate on whether universities should assess students based on regular assignments instead of a final exam. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue. \n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that offering regular assignments is a better option due to the fact that it results in better learning outcomes. This is because this practice breaks the task up into parts and sets time intervals between assessments, which motivates students to prepare and revise the learning material on a regular basis. To illustrate this, a monthly quiz is a convincing example.

Therefore, average performance tends to be a better indication.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that regular assessments are more suitable.

    "question_answer": "In the contemporary society, governments are faced with a downward trend in fertility and an increase in the share of older individuals. In this essay, I am going to investigate the consequence of ageing population and then offer some solutions. \n\nIt is evidently reasonable for some to believe that the consequence of ageing population can be devastating. This is because an increasing number of elderly people impose substantial pressure on the economy and the health care system. Indeed, the more people retire, the more onerous the pension burden the state has to carry. This may hurt economic growth and the overall quality of life because more public spending is diverted from education and infrastructure investment to finance programs for the elderly. What is more, the labour force also suffers due to the shortage of productive workers who often make the most significant contribution to society.\n\nOn the basis of the above consequence, the solutions to this problem should also be many.  Governments have the responsibility and obligation to take some actions. Firstly, medical advances and health programmes might allow older adults to stay healthy and work for longer. Secondly, people should be rewarded by having more children. At last, importing immigrants is also a viable choice for increasing the young workforce.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think the issues of the ageing population can be solved one day in the future. Additionally, I would suggest that it seems highly wise and vital for the government to implement those mentioned pertinent and prompt policy solutions.",

There has been a heated debate on whether governments should provide free health care or free education. As far as I am concerned, I tend to believe that governments should attach heavier weight to health care. \n\nIt is reasonable to believe that governments should give priority to health care due to the fact that public health is the key determinant of a good quality of life, and it is the governments responsibility to provide standard healthcare. This is because government budgets are raised by taxing working people, and thus citizens should be the primary beneficiaries. To illustrate this, income tax is a convincing example. Additionally, it is the welfare of seeing doctors for free that has significantly reduced citizens expenditures on health, thus saving their costs of living. As a result, their living standard has improved. \n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed that education is an essential factor for a countrys development because educated workers lay the foundation for a countrys economic growth.  Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that governments have the full responsibilities for supporting the poor to have equal access to the medical treatment. That is to say, it is inhumane to refuse to help someone dying based on the condition that they cannot afford medical services. This will result in social injustice and is unfavourable for maintaining social order. \n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that medical care should be made freely available for every citizen.

    "question_answer": "Some people think the celebrities are famous because of their appearance and wealth rather than their achievements which will lead to bad effect to young people. While from my point of view, not all celebrities are admired for their glamour and money, some of them reached great achievement due to their hard working and effort.\n\nIt is true that some celebrities they are known well for their beautiful appearance and luxury life style. For example, some actors they always post expensive cloth and luxury bags pictures to the Internet as they want to get more attention from public. When young people see these pics, they will looking forward to this kind of life like these actors and it indeed affect their motivation to get more for them through working. If every young people have this idea, all of them want to get stuff without effort, then it will give negative effect for the society. In addition, some celebrities does some improper things like drugs or drive after drunk, which is also make bad role model for young people.\n\nNevertheless, I believe there are some celebrities who are acting good example for young people because they get what they have through their effort. Firstly, some sports player they are payed more only if they got good score and wined the game, which motivate young people to contribute more to the society and community to get more for their-selves. Secondly, some famous entertainment popular star, people fond of them because they can deliver good movies or TV series to people to make people's life more enjoyable. Finally, some great novel authors they use their talent to born the great article for us, which is also make our life more beautiful.\n\nIn conclusion, there are some celebrities which contribute to guide young people to right direction, while for the celebrities which have bad effects to society, the broadcast organization should prohibit unhealthy images public.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to emigration never fails to attract public attention. There has been a heated debate on whether the advantages of immigrating into a foreign country outweigh its disadvantages. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue. \n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that relocating to a new country is favourable to ones development due to the fact that such an experience contributes to an expansion of knowledge. This is because, with travel, comes the power of knowledge and learning. To be more specific, travelling to new cities and countries allows one to gain a penetrating insight into different cultures, languages, and histories, which helps individuals to become more open-minded and tolerant. To illustrate this, increased tolerance towards multi-cultural societies is a convincing example. As a result, social harmony has improved. \n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that culture shock may be triggered by the differences in living situations, food, transportation and social mannerisms.  However, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that migrating to a foreign country usually accompanies personal growth. That is to say, when a person moves to a new state, he or she will be thrown into brand new situations and settings that may seem intimidating and scary at first, but challenges are always the best ways to grow for an individual because those challenges impel immigrants to improve their physical and emotional skills continually. \n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that moving to a new country comes with more advantages. Despite the fact that it may cause culture shock, people migrating to a foreign country have a broader horizon and a chance to achieve self-growth.",

There has been a heated debate on whether popular culture courses are a valid subject in universities. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that these courses are of vital importance due to the fact that students need a global awareness and understanding of other cultures. This is because such an approach helps students to gain interesting insights about how and why people behave so differently in different cultures. Better yet, the knowledge you gain has very practical application in business and other fields today. To illustrate this, pop music is a convincing example. As a result, with a broadened horizon, those open-minded students tend to gain improved employability by popular culture courses. \n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that paying more attention to academic performance is required and traditional courses should be seen as the first priority. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that popular culture courses are able to enrich the curriculum and boost learning interest and passion. That is to say, students tend to develop various interests and hobbies in order to achieve all-round development.

    "question_text": "Should parents be held legally responsible for the actions of their children? Do you agree with this opinion? Support your position with your own study, experience or observations.",
    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether parents should be held legally responsible for the actions of their children never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that parents should be accountable for their kids, others hold the view that this is not sustainable in the long-term. In my opinion, I think that parents are legally responsible for their children, but only up to a certain age. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that parents are liable for their childrens actions, on account of their direct influence. To be more specific, young children depend on their parents for guidance in distinguishing right from wrong, as they are yet to establish their own mature judgment. For example, a recent article published in The Age states, 90% of illegal acts committed by young children were found to be unintentional, and were mainly a result of a lack of supervision by parents. It is thus clearly shown that parents should be held legally accountable for their childrens misconduct. \n\nHowever, this is only valid up to a certain age. This is because as children mature, they develop the ability to reflect and evaluate the consequences of their own actions. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, young adults who committed unlawful acts were aware that their actions were wrong and could warrant punishments by the law, but still chose to go ahead. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that the legal consequences of their actions should then fall upon them to take on, rather than their parents. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that parents should be held legally responsible for the actions of their children, but in fairness, only for those of younger ages.",

    "question_answer": "In the modern society, bickering between couples has led to polygamy and high divorce rate. In this essay, I am going to investigate the positive and negative effects about it. \n\nIt is evidently reasonable for some to believe that such a trend tends to have negative effects on children. The first point with respect to this is that if parents get divorced, children are then forced to live with one of them. To be more specific, while the single parent has to juggle both jobs as well as domestic duties, children seldom receive attention for their healthy growth. Moreover, permanent absence of one parent would create serious psychological problems for the young generations. To illustrate this, children with aggressive behaviour is a convincing example. As a result, children of divorced parents suffer from stress, anxiety and depression in their childhood.\n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that people will be happier if divorced than if they stay unhappily married. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that divorce impacts economic opportunities. That is to say, when couples are divorced, more housing, power and resources are required. Apart from that, after getting divorced, productivity and wage gains in men decrease, compared to women who tend to apply for welfare benefits because of a disrupted marriage.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think that the above-mentioned problem can be solved one day in the future. Additionally, I would suggest that it seems highly wise and vital for parents to avoid bickering by striking smooth communication in their marriages.",

As a result, making users pay for the online content can help the realization of healthier and sustainable development of the Internet. \n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that such content should be free because profitable business models can be built on free content. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that intellectual property rights must be honored. That is to say, respecting IPR reflects the progress of mankind and also protects the IPR owners legal rights and benefits. \n\nIn a nutshell, due to the above-mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that the users should pay for what they enjoy online. Despite the fact that this can make some users unhappy, we can gain a more balanced development for the Internet.",

    "question_answer": "The topic with respect to arts never fails to attract public attention. There has been a heated debate on whether a government should not be responsible for investing in arts such as painting and music but be responsible for investing in practical areas. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the opponent regarding this issue. \n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that the government has the duty to invest in arts due to the fact that arts can enrich peoples cultural life. This is because artistic works can provide various entertainments for the general public. For example, artistic forms like music, painting and opera are very popular among people in almost every community.  Also, arts are also the symbols of each country for displaying and preserving the vital heritage of the existing traditions and cultures. As a result, arts are indispensable for both an individual and a society, which requires the governments investment.\n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that the governments investment should be focused on strengthening the infrastructure and public services. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that arts are also beneficial for economic reasons. That is to say, some artistic outputs have contributed heavily to the economic growth of a country. Movies, music or theater have increased the tax revenue for the government.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the above-mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that a government has the responsibility for investing in artistic areas. Despite the fact that such investment may not fuel economic growth directly, it can have a broader significance for the whole society.",

There has been a heated debate on whether they should accept lessons about principles of personal finance. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that these courses are significant for young people due to the fact that they can appreciate the value of money. This is because, through these lessons such as how to spend wisely or loan risk, they can learn where it comes from, how it can be spent and more importantly, the value that it has in the life of their family. For example, a child who saves up for his own Play Station will understand the value of money and appreciate it more. As a result, the ultimate goal of such lessons is that teenagers can develop the important meaning and use of saving. \n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that dealing with money too early makes the young materialistic. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that teaching kids about money improve the decision-making ability and it is also a great way to foster a responsible attitude in them. That is to say, when they have to consider the consequences of their actions in terms of money, this process develops their decision-making skills and the sense of responsibility to face the consequences. \n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that exposing students to lessons about personal finances could be a desirable option.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to the design of buildings never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that the design of a building affects peoples work and life positively, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I strongly believe that the design has more advantages than disadvantages due to environmental friendliness and working efficiency.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that the design of buildings is essential on account of its positive impacts on the environment. Although the potential negative impacts of fully covered buildings, such as the lack of natural lighting and ventilation, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that a well-designed building helps to reduce the energy consumptions and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 70% of buildings in Europe are now equipped with solar panels, which can save up to 7 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year. Thus, it is clearly shown that these eco-friendly buildings could help to save the environment.\n\nFurthermore, the working efficiency and effectiveness also add weight to my argument. This is because the design of buildings often includes the consideration of features such as daylight, connection to nature, and spaces for social interaction, which will boost work performance and productivity. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 90% of employees in developed countries feel more motivated to work in a well-designed office. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that the design of buildings plays a major role in improving working efficiency. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned environmental friendliness and working efficiency, I wholeheartedly endorse that the design of buildings has positive impacts on peoples life and work.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to work-life balance never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that the problem that people devote more time to jobs is widespread, others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I strongly agree that work-life conflict is a widespread and serious problem that impacts workers, their employers and communities.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that the problem spreads widely especially among young people on account of fierce competition. To be specific, many young workers are trying to survive and be successful, and this forces them to spend more than eight hours per day at work. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of employees in China suffer under long hours in office, pressure from managers and project deadlines created by clients, which results in their personal lives becoming ignored. Thus, work-life balance is a major problem due to the competitive environment.\n\nFurthermore, the problems caused by long work hours cannot be ignored. This is because working overtime means less free time to spend with family members, which can often lead to an unhealthy relationship. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, when married mothers are employed for more hours per week, it adversely affects marital quality by decreasing couples' time together or increasing feelings of role conflict and work overload. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that more frequent fatigue experienced by those with extra work hours leads to more frequent interference with family members.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that despite the fact that we may get properly paid, working overtime is detrimental especially to our health.",

Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that many employers are seeking talents with the high moral standard.

While some people think that experience is more effective and useful than books and formal education, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the opposite view. In my opinion, I strongly believe that experience will bring more benefits due to career development and a powerful network.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that compared to classroom knowledge, experience has more advantages on account of career development. Although the potential positive impacts of formal education, such as academic knowledge and professional skills, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that experience could equip students with the soft skills needed to succeed in any organization. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of graduates agree that teamworking skills strengthen their competitiveness in future jobs. Thus, it is clearly shown that with useful experience, people could quickly adjust themselves to companies rules and regulations, and this would benefit their careers directly.\n\nFurthermore, the powerful network also adds weight to my argument. This is because people can contact and learn from professionals in their realms. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 90% of students take advantage of a powerful network for their career promotions, and it also helps them avoid common mistakes of career planning in the future. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that life experience effectively helps students broaden their social networks.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that useful experience is a key factor in students future careers.",

As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that science shows more significant values than art due to the fact that it raises our living standards and makes our lives physically better. This is because the development of science leads to inventions in workplaces, which replaces physical labors and boosts our working efficiency and effectiveness. To illustrate this, using the computer to avoid repetitive work is a convincing example. As a result, more time can be left for relaxation and recreational activities, which improves our life quality.\n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that art makes us happy and fulfill our emotional needs to some extent. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that the development of science has shaped this planets infrastructures and would allow the human race to continuously progress. That is to say, people cannot live without science as it provides us with improved food, water, transportations, and cures to diseases.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reason, we may safely reach the conclusion that science is more important than art.

While some people think that a penalty for late assignments can generate positive outcomes, others hold the view that it can be unfair to students. In my opinion, I believe that universities should deduct marks, but alternative actions should also be discussed. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that penalising overdue assignments is beneficial, on account of the improvement to time management. Although the potential negative impacts of late penalties, such as added stress, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that late penalties have tremendously improved students lives in various ways. To be more specific, it forces students to develop their time management skills and sense of punctuality so as to avoid the penalty. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 90% of students admitted that their awareness of deadlines and their ability to manage time wisely started during university years when they had to balance assignments and examinations. It is thus clearly shown that deducting marks for late assignments can be beneficial. \n\nHowever, alternative actions should also be considered. This is because the penalty can be unfair to students who actually had a valid reason for handing in their assignments late. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, 90% of students could produce a medical certificate or other forms of proof for their late submission. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that universities should consider assessing students situations before deciding their marks. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that universities should deduct marks, but should also make an effort to take up other actions that can help ensure fairness.",

While some people think that public transport is more vital, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that governments should concentrate on building more roads. In my opinion, I strongly believe that public transportation brings more benefits due to environmental friendliness and financial reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that it is more essential to develop an adequate transport network on account of environmental friendliness. Although the potential positive impacts of constructing more roads, such as urbanization and increased employment rate, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that an efficient public transport network will significantly reduce private car usage, which would critically lower the emission of greenhouse gases. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Carbon dioxide emission from private vehicles is the major reason contributing to global warming. Thus, it is clearly shown that a better travel network would promote sustainable development in the long-term.\n\nFurthermore, the financial reason also adds weight to my argument. This is because public transport is more cost-effective than private vehicles. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, people who to travel work via public transport spend 45% less on commuting each year than those who drive in to work.

As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that music is more than significant due to the fact that it helps children to develop their well-rounded skills and enhance their study performances. This is because the ability to deeply appreciate music has usually been linked to creativity, imagination and intellectual curiosity, all of which contribute significantly to childrens academic excellence, as well as comprehensive development. \n\nTo illustrate this, it is a convincing example that many top students have developed their interest in music at a very young age.

Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that if properly chosen, certain types of music can help release pressure, thus enhancing learning efficiency.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to medical advancements never fails to attract public attention. There has been a heated debate on whether the remote diagnosis is more advantageous than disadvantageous. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that such an approach is beneficial due to the fact that online communication between doctors and patients could reduce medical costs and increase diagnostic efficiency. This is because this new technology enables the real-time monitoring of patient as well as timely responses from doctors, thus significantly cutting down the time of treatment process. As patients are not required to visit the hospital on a regular basis, medical services become more time-saving and cost-effective. To illustrate this, online diagnosis is a convincing example. As a result, the whole medical system would operate more efficiently, which could also enhance patients experience, improving peoples living standard considerably. \n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that such practice may raise the issues of patients privacy security and data accuracy. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that such an advancement would hugely raise the outcomes of treatment. That is to say, through this technology, physicians are able to build a database, which enables them to work systematically. Moreover, they can also access real-time information and make informed decisions, all of which contribute largely to improving medical service quality.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that the remote diagnosis is helpful.

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether experiential learning can work well in formal education never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that it can be beneficial in high schools and colleges, on the other end of the spectrums, others believe that traditional forms of teaching are still the best. In my opinion, I tend to be an advocate of experiential learning, due to the following reasons. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that experiential learning enhances school education on account of the reinforcement factor. Although the potential positive impacts of more traditional forms of education, such as time-efficiency, should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that hands-on learning has tremendously increased students performance in various ways. To be more specific, applying theories to practice allows students to deepen their grasp of academic concepts, and accelerate their learning. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Students who conducted science experiments in school performed 80% better in formal examinations than those who only learnt the theories. It is thus clearly shown that experiential learning can reinforce knowledge learnt.\n\nFurthermore, the motivation factor also adds weight to my argument. This is because different types of experiential learning, such as building models, making films, going on camps and fieldtrips, are more exciting and engaging for students, which increases their learning interest. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, colleges that ran fieldtrips had a higher attendance rate for all their classes. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that learning outside a traditional academic setting increases student motivation. \n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that experiential learning brings significant benefits, and schools should support and incorporate such learning methods in their curriculum.",

There has been a heated debate on whether studying films at school is as important as studying literature. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue.\n\nIt is evidently reasonable for me to believe that film study plays as important a role as studying literature due to the fact that this approach of education is easier for students especially those young ones to engage and digest. This is because comparing to literature, it is easier for students to understand the content of films, on the other hand, with the straight-forward and entertaining traits, films are more likely to spark students motivation and interest to study the subject. To illustrate this, Disney movies are a convincing example. As a result, films are embedded in the curriculum, and film studies are considered as viable an option for pupils as music and art.\n\nIn contrast, it is commonly believed as a fact that students should spend more time on literature studying for it stands for the merit of historical heritage. Nevertheless, this argument does not hold water. It should be pointed out that the studying of these contemporary arts including films helps to boost students confidence. That is to say, films, along with other performing arts in this day and age, helps young people to think outside the box and be more confident thus students would believe themselves about their ideas and abilities.\n\nIn a nutshell, due to the mentioned reasons, we may safely reach the conclusion that films are an indispensable part of our education.

    "question_answer": "It is believed that advertisement is a prime source of a business which contributes to generate a large amount of fund for any organization or corporation like schools. However, some argue that schools are not an appropriate place to place advertisement in the name of extra fund collection. I will be in favor of the last notion.\n\nTo begin with, placing advertisements in schools will distract juveniles who do not have controlling power on themselves as psychological aspect of children needs to be considered before placing an advertisement in school. School children might less concentrate on their studies and more focus on colorful advertisements because of which their future will be uncertain as they will not be able to pass their course easily. For example, a child who is in the habit of involving in various advertising campaigns since childhood, lacks behind on his or her studies. In the same way, young pupils will be obsessed with money and if there is a shortage of money in any stage of their life while growing, they might indulge in an illegal act to achieve money.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, there are positive aspect as well, as children may get a good opportunity for future and they can shape their life by following only positive outcomes of advertisement.\n\nTo conclude, the latter notion outweighs the first one as students should focus on their studies at this age rather than highlighting in other aspect like advertisement. Therefore, Advertisements should be banned from the schools. We should ensure a good and quiet place for kids to study.",

I agree that this change has a significant effect on developed countries and I would like to share my views on the same.\n\nFirstly, earlier those days, the industrialization had just started. Many people started looking for new opportunities outside their native. As the local opportunities were limited, so people easily got their jobs in better places other than their own countries. This led to inflow of immigrants and subsequently, rise in the population started to begin.\n\nFurthermore, when the immigrants took the developed nations lucrative jobs, the locals were deprived from their right to work within their own countries. This badly hampered the situation. People started to rebel, they became involved in social offences and opted for easy money earning. These not only made the situation worst, but also made the narcotic products popular within the new generations.\n\nTo conclude, the 18th century boom in industrialization has hampered both lifestyle and led to the instability of social equilibrium.",

    "question_answer": "With globalization and rise of industries, the competition to be the best and on the top of the market has also increased. Companies use various methods and strategies to compete with each other. One of these measures is placing offers and discounts on their products. This essay will discuss the influence of this strategy on its reputation.\n\nTo begin with, discounts and offers placed on the products increase its sales. Many a times people buy products which are not required only because there is a discount on it. This helps the company to make the consumers aware of their product in the market. When a product is newly introduced in the market, a low price is quoted, so that the buyers give it a preference over the other known items. Once, the buyers are familiar with the product and the sales increase, the discounts are taken off. This is a very lucrative method used by the companies today.\n\nNevertheless, sometimes these strategies fail. Many times, people doubt the quality of the products with offers. They think that the materials used to make those items are cheap and low quality and hence do not buy it although they are available at a very low cost than the other similar products. Furthermore, people buy these items only till the offers exist and once the actual price is quoted, they think it is highly priced and hence avoid buying it. Some consumers have a liking towards a particular company product and do not buy items from other companies. This results in loss to those industries which are selling their products with offers and discounts.\n\nTo conclude, although offers and discounts increase the sales of the products, companies should also think of its reputation. They should also develop other strategies to attract consumers.",

    "question_text": "If voting is compulsory in democratic society, what conclusions can we draw about Nature of democracy?",
    "question_answer": "Compulsory voting in a democratic society is undeniably a controversial topic as it raises a question: how democratic a nation will be with or without compulsory voting. This system has many benefits to the nation if it is implemented in a right manner. In this essay, we will discuss the nature of democracy with few examples of compulsory voting.\n\nDemocracy is also known as a Republic, is a governing system where the citizens of the country vote to one of the several parties competing for the Presidents position. If only 30% of the people vote then the outcome of the election will be unfair, as those who did not vote may not like the party that won the election. For instance, In America, Bill Clinton won when mere 34% of the total population voted. Similarly, in India on an average, only 50 to 55% of the people vote and rest have to accept the rules drafted by the unwanted members of the parliament.\n\nTurning to the compulsory casting of the vote, in Australia casting vote is compulsory since last 80 years. Almost 90% of the public participates and there is a little fine for those who dont participate. Moreover, in South American nations like Peru and Bolivia, there is harsh punitive action against those who dont vote. For example, Non-Voters are barred from accessing their own bank accounts for up to 3 months. This is the reason there are some people who are against compulsory voting.\n\nIn a nutshell it can be said that compulsory casting of a vote is an imperative step in a democratic society, however, its implication in a friendly manner is of vital importance. So compulsory voting is mandatory for a democracy to be a democracy.",

    "question_answer": "There is too much debate about whether children should be learned to be more competitive or cooperative members of society. In my opinion, both behaviors are important and cooperation is more important than competition.\n\nOn one hand, as we live in the very competitive society, we need to teach our children the sense of competition in a positive way. The most obvious advantage to encourage competition among children is that it makes them more creative and open minded and opens the doors for better future opportunities for them. For illustration, children work hard in the study because they compete with other classmates to receive high marks, this will help them to get a very good job in the future. Moreover, they become more independent and rely on themselves because they know that nobody else will be there to do their duties.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that cooperation is mandatory to be encouraged for many reasons. Firstly, cooperation helps children to learn from each other. For example, when I was at school team, I learned how to play table  tennis  with  my friends and we learn a lot  of skills from each other and when we play in the final round with other school teams,  we get a very good score in the final. Secondly, cooperation teaches children the skills linked to sharing, as a result, they become a kind member of society. Finally, cooperation is the key component for better personality as well as prevent from individuality.\n\nTo sum up, both cooperation and competition have their own advantages. However, I tend to think that cooperation should be encouraged more in children.",

    "question_answer": "There are different perspectives about printing papers, newspapers. However, the printing ways to provide the news cannot cope with the fast changing society and the development of technologies makes it easier for people to acquire information. Therefore, I completely agree that there will be no need for printing newspapers.\n\nNewspapers would not need to be printed, because people are surrounded by information and easily shared within their societal group. They can easily update and share information with each other and can enhance their relationships. For example, people are associated with at least one societal group such as a school or a work. From there, people can easily share the latest news each other and can develop the communication.\n\nBy the time, newspapers being printed and published, the news become outdated and the information may irrelevant. Since we are living in a fast-moving society and the newspapers and news should be changed at rapidity. In the case of US election, for instance, all the other technologies have kept updating with the process of elections whereas the newspapers only published with the final result. Therefore, publishing papers cannot follow with the speed of society changes.\n\nPrinted papers, newspapers would disappear because people use alternative forms to acquire information. It is a fact that, a majority of the people already acquire information through TV, internet or mobile phones for its convenience. Lets take an example for my house, my grandmother acquired news from TV, my parents received the news from internet and I heard about the latest news through mobile phones. Therefore, people have changed the ways to acquire information overtime.\n\nIn conclusion, the weakness of printed newspapers cannot overtake the strengths of modern technologies and societal group. Therefore, the demand for printing would be reduced.",

    "question_text": "Most high-level jobs are done by men. Should governments encourage that a certain percentage of these jobs be reserved to women? What is your opinion?",
    "question_answer": "The rapid industrialization throughout the 21st century resulted in the startup of multinational companies across the globe. The statistics reported by the Financial Times in September 2015 claims that 90 percent of the top-level positions are occupied by men on an average across all companies.  Although, I believe that women must be prepared to take over higher positions, I refute that some proportion of top level jobs to be reserved for women.\n\nFirstly, a company can expect a catastrophic failure in if any top-level decision goes astray, especially if the decision involves multi-billion dollars. For instance, a big finance firm named ABC based in Germany went bankrupt in the second quarter of 2014 due to a wrong decision by its president, who was promoted to the top position based on reservation. Moreover, the board of directors need to scrutinize the top posts with extreme care based on his or her merits, irrespective of gender. Therefore, it is obvious that the top positions should not fall under the reservation policy.\n\nSecondly, ignoring an efficient person to fill in a new position leads to discrimination and engenders the lack of motivation among the employees. For example, if a person is simply promoted to the top post, leaving behind the capable colleagues, there are high chances that the colleagues, who think the decision is not fair, will not work efficiently to their caliber. As a result, it is the organization which loses the productivity. Thus, the top positions should never be reserved based on gender or any category\n\nIn conclusion, by analyzing how reservation can lead to poor decision making as well as decrease productivity, reservation should not be in place for top posts. Governments should ensure that they give enough focus to empower women and head positions should be filled in based on merit irrespective of anything.",

    "question_text": "Does the advent of internet change the role of teacher? To what extent do you agree?",
    "question_answer": "There is no doubt that with the advent of computers, the education system and the learning procedure have seen some major changes. Gone are the days of searching through books and making notes on a notebook, we are in an era where every information is just a click away. However, in my opinion, the role of teachers in a student's life cannot be overshadowed by any technology; it might change but not disappear completely.\n\nNobody can argue that computers have made learning more interactive, fun and easy. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an enjoyable task for a kid. This accompanied with a relaxing environment, interactive software, usually conduce to better grasping of knowledge. For instance, a student learning or cramming the functioning of heart and referring to the 2D diagrams is less likely to remember a concept than a student who is watching exactly what is happening through videos.\n\nFurthermore, at higher educational level; the online resources such as open universities offering free courses, provide them with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would not be at hand.\n\nBut, besides the great advantages software offers, the need of human interaction will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is a necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the specifics needs of each individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how sophisticated its software is.\n\nTo summarize, in my opinion, teachers play and will play a very important role in the classroom, especially at the primary level. The only thing possible is to change how teachers interact, replacing them completely can dampen the education system, no matter how sophisticated the software be.",

    "question_text": "In the education system, assessment through written formal examinations is still valid or not? /  Formal written examinations can be a valid method to assess students learning. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether formal written examinations can be a valid method to assess students learning never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that written exams are still an effective and efficient way of testing students, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that these tests cannot accurately measure students abilities. In my opinion, I believe that written examinations are valid to an extent, but they also have limitations. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that written examinations are still effective in assessing student performance, on account of the importance of theoretical foundations. To be more specific, written examinations can assess students retention of concepts and information taught in classes, which are the fundamental blocks for further learning. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Students who achieved over 85% in mathematics written exams during their younger year levels, were more successful in tackling tougher math problems in their older year levels. Thus, it is clearly shown that written examinations can still be a strong gauge of students abilities. \n\nHowever, the limited nature of this assessment method cannot be ignored. This is because written examinations cannot evaluate students grasp of skills in practical scenarios. For instance, according to a study conducted by HKU, achieving high scores in the written section of language examinations does not indicate whether a student can use the language in real-life and hold day-to-day conversations. Without a doubt, it is clearly demonstrated that written assessments may not be an entirely valid way of evaluating the various aspects of students learning.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that written examinations are a valid indicator of students learning levels to a certain extent.",

    "question_answer": "Decision making not only requires collection of facts and data, it demands a real experience of the situation and empathetic approaches; it is only feasible if employees are involved in decision making process because being a part of organization they have more reliable data on workforce issues.\n\nOrganization is a group of people who direct their actions towards attainment of a common goal; therefore, middle and low-level employees can provide more efficient solutions or decisions which will enhance productivity because higher level people generally have less penetrating data on actual alternatives out of which a best can be selected in decision making process effectively by the employees.\n\nMost of the time employees feel left behind and compelled by the decisions imposed by the higher authorities on them and sometimes that decision is not even practical which leads to wastage of resources. For instance, during my clinical practice as a nurse, our manager initiated half hourly rounds in patients' room at night which wasted nurses valuable time of actual interventions and made patients so restless and sick that hospital stay time increased and brought negative outcomes which could be avoided if nurses could have involved in the decision-making process.\n\nIn short, including employees in this process will also motivate them and make them feel significant in the organization which in turn will fortify better mutual relationships and uphill struggle. However, the decision should be made finally by the managers but acquiring employees' opinion will enhance implementation and fruitful outcome of the decision.",

    "question_answer": "Technology gave us an abundance of devices to utilize; TV is one of them. In my opinion, among its several benefits, news and awareness is of paramount significance as compared to entertaining screenplays. TV really acts like a companion if we use it appropriately to a satisfactory extent.\n\nTelevision provides us a sophisticated knowledge regarding a variety of topics in a detailed and focused way; several lectures of experts and interviews of accomplished persons stimulate the youngsters in positive way and catalyze the surge of learning something new. But this can only be possible if the channels are selected carefully such as BBC, Nat Geo, and Discovery. Most of the channels are producing misleading shows in a race of profit which affects adolescents in a negative way, these should be neglected.\n\nTV is very beneficial for older people who live alone; in my practice as a nurse, TV is used as a diversional therapy to ease anguish as well as it is a very efficient method to fight with anxiety and depression. This is even useful for those older people who don't have access to internet or can't operate technical devices to surf internet, they can listen to news and other information though TV.\n\nIn short, TV can be used in numerous effective ways for educational purposes and to create attentiveness among people related to current issues; misguiding shows should be censored by the government to make it more relevant.",

    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether the mass media influences our society and shapes our opinions and characters never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that the mass media does have influence on our society and shape our views, on the other end of the spectrum others hold the view that the mass media has no impact on people. Having always believed that the mass media influences our society and shapes our opinions and characters, I tend to be the advocate regarding this issue due to closer relationships and multifaceted information.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that the mass media can strengthen social cohesion on account of the closer relationships. Granted that its pivotal to be aware of potentially negative impacts of the mass media, I still maintain that TV, radio and newspaper has tremendously enriched peoples lives in various ways. For example, a renowned American writer Mark Twain once said, Current affairs and global concerns are shared to help develop social cohesion. It is thus clearly shown that the mass media can help strengthen social cohesion.\n\nFurthermore, the multifaceted information also adds weight to my argument. Conventional wisdom has it that ultimately the aim of the mass media is creating information sharing platform. For instance, findings of recent research conducted at the University of Melbourne revealed that 38% of people develop their critical thinking with the help of multifaceted information on the mass media. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that various information on the mass media can help shape our opinions.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned closer relationships and multifaceted information, I wholeheartedly endorse that the mass media influences our society and shapes our opinions and characters.",

While some people think that governments should take responsibility, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that big companies and individuals are also accountable. In my opinion, governments and big companies should take most of the responsibility due to their level of influence and impact in society. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that governments should be responsible on account of their societal influence. To be more specific, governments have the power to enact laws and regulations that can help control global warming. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, Countries that implemented carbon tax policies last year had already seen a 20% decrease in their carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, it is clearly shown that governments should be responsible for mitigating climate change as they have significant power to influence change.  \n\nHowever, the role of big companies cannot be ignored. This is because large corporations are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by the University of Melbourne, the top 100 manufacturing companies in the world account for 90% of the release of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere through their burning of fossil fuels. Without a doubt, this demonstrates that large corporations should also be held responsible for global warming.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned reasons, I wholeheartedly endorse that governments and big companies should assume responsibility for the issue of climate change.

While some people think that their success cannot be defined by the place where they grew up, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that their native lands do affect their accomplishments. In my opinion, I strongly believe that peoples achievements should be partly attributed to their living environments because these places can indicate their personality and provide resources necessary for their development.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that peoples living environments do influence their success due to the different resources these environments can provide.

Thus, it is clearly shown that peoples success can be affected by the resources provided by their living environments.\n\nFurthermore, the geographical identity also adds weight to my argument. This is because people often make assumptions about a person based upon where he or she is from, which can impact a candidates electoral success. For instance, according to a study conducted by HKU, in some countries, over 60% of the presidential candidates cannot get elected because they are born and raised in big cities.

    "question_answer": "The development of society is going towards a globalised world where education is an essential foundation for personal, social and economic success. International studies are becoming a new trend for young people as a way to expand their education beyond their traditional education style. It is agreed that adding a foreign qualification has become an integral part of higher studies. This argument is proven by looking at how it widens people's perspective and helps them with better career opportunities.\n\nStudying abroad helps people increase their awareness about different cultures of the world. This will contribute in creating individuals with a broader understanding of issues concerning today's society rather than limiting them in a scope of home education system. For example, universities have a large community of students both from the local area and all around the globe. The diverse academic community enhances the quality of learning by providing wider spectrum of opinions and expertise. This example clearly shows that international education enhances outlook and sharpens self-awareness. Therefore, we can say that traveling is an important element of education.\n\nMoreover, acquiring a globally recognized qualification or degree opens the doors for international job market. The students gain more knowledge and expertise when abroad and apply them to situations requiring international interactions. Also, employers look for the graduates with international experience either by studying or working abroad. Thus, we can say that international studies add value to a student's education.\n\nIn summary, it can be said that travelling to foreign countries for higher studies is a key to succeed in this globalised planet.",

    "question_answer": "It might be true that private automobile owners reflect wealth status of individual. A number of private automobile has soared since a decade ago, yet it has produced traffic congestion and some pollution. Based on that issues, I totally agree if the number of own car per house is limited and I will discuss the reasonable reason in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe first, the overwhelming number of private automobile is not synergy with the large of roads. It becomes the primary factor of traffic jam since the roads being overcrowded, which contributing most people spend their time in the road. The capital city of Indonesia, for instance, has occurred increase of traffic congestion annually due to individual car possess. In consequence, traffic jam is able to make late either for students or workers. Indeed, it takes up amount of their energy. Therefore, it is vital to strict the number of car in a house (a car per house) in order to reduce the traffic congestion.\n\nLook at to the other consequence, the high number of car private contributes the amount of pollutions, particularly air pollution. As people know that gas emission from fuel are contain numerous gasses which is dominated by carbon dioxide. Breathing carbon dioxide up is eminent in case human's organ damage. Moreover, pollution is capable of accelerating the humans aging, making people seem like older than the actual age. So, limitation of car owner is the one of ways to make a fall the amount pollution.\n\nTo sum up, people are able to save their time effectively in the road if there is no traffic jam anymore, also they can enhance longevity of life. I absolutely agree if the government create the rules about restriction of number of car per home.",

    "question_answer": "Climate change is a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I totally disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.\n\nThere are various measures that governments and people could take to prevent climate change. Governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose green taxes on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate change, by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. \n\nIf instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.",

    "question_answer": "Governments of all the countries around the world has fixed an age above which both males and females can get married. Age of an individual plays a crucial role in marriages. In many societies, children are got married during childhood or even before they start earning. I strongly disagree with this practice.\n\nTo begin with, marriage is a huge responsibility, and one should be prepared for all the challenges associated with it. Children going to school are not physically, mentally and emotionally fit to face the difficulties of this relationship. The body of adolescent kids is not prepared for physical intimacy which is an inevitable part of a marriage. This results in early age pregnancies which are life-threatening for the mother as well as the child. These early age marriages have resulted in the rise of premature delivery, stillbirths, death of young mothers during childbirth and anemic mother and child. If this continues of the nation would be dark.\n\nSecondly, there are a lot of financial problems faced by individuals who marry without having a secured job. This has led to poor living quality of the individuals. They are unable to take care of their families which causes depression and frustration. Lack of money and market inflation has led these people into taking illegal measures and hence destroy peace and harmony in society. \n\nTo conclude, I believe that education and financial security makes an individual truly eligible for marriage. These two factors are a necessity to live a healthy and desirable life.",

    "question_answer": "Information revolution has changed our life drastically, as it has made roads to all walks of life. Undoubtedly it has changed the way of mass communication which has its own pros and cons. I agree with this statement that it has negative and positive effect on the person as well as the society because of easily access of information, get expert opinion, less wastage of time and on contrary, misuse of information and spreading rumours.\n\nThe first and foremost, due to information revolution of mass media, people can have easy access to information on any topic as it is available just a click away because of internet. Moreover, one can get any expert opinion about the information. Also, getting information fast saves a lot of time because everything is available online. For example, few decades ago we can use the library physically and read books and find any information, but now time has changed now in 21st century, we can access all the books, blogs, and information on our computer or television.\n\nEvery coin has two sides, so the information can also be abused. It can mislead people and can cause damage to society. Moreover, people misuse information and that can lead to rumours and even create violence. For instance, information or posts on social media like Face book and Twitter are unsafe as it can create problems in the on the name on religion or anything. Furthermore, wrong elements of society can use information in an inappropriate way like making bombs, guns.\n\nIn a nutshell, we can say that society should use the electronic information for the betterment of the society as a whole. If person have any doubt about any information then he should confirm first with Right to Information Act, before taking any action.",

    "question_text": "Some people think that human behaviours can be limited and controlled by laws, while others think that laws have little effect. What is your opinion?",
    "question_answer": "The controversial topic with respect to whether laws change human behaviour never fails to attract public attention. While some people think that the law plays an essential role in disciplining peoples behaviour, on the other end of the spectrum, others hold the view that imposing laws on people has little effect unless it is enforced with proper punishments. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this statement mentioned above because it is the punishments and the law enforcements that secure peoples obedience.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is evidently reasonable for one to think that people will not obey the law if there is no consequence for their offenses. Although the potential positive impacts of the law itself should be taken into consideration, I still maintain that it is the punishments that have tremendously changed peoples lives in various ways. For example, a recent article published in The Economist states, 80% the people who had been sent to jail once never tried to commit a crime for the second time. Thus, it is clearly shown that a proper penalty system should be established alongside the law.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of the law enforcements also adds weight to my argument. This is because law enforcements like the police can work as an instructor to guide people to abide by the law. For instance, according to a recent study conducted by HKU, no pedestrian tried to jump the red light as usual with the presence of a traffic police officer. Without a doubt, it is clearly shown that it is the law enforcements that urge people to change their behaviour.\n\nIn a nutshell, for the aforementioned penalty system and law enforcements, I wholeheartedly endorse that the law can affect peoples behaviour only if it can impose threats to those who offend it.",

    "question_answer": "With globalization and rise of industries, the competition to be the best and on the top of the market has also increased. Companies use various methods and strategies to compete with each other. One of these measures is placing offers and discounts on their products. This essay will discuss the influence of this strategy on its reputation.\n\nTo begin with, discounts and offers placed on the products increase its sales. Many a times people buy products which are not required only because there is a discount on it. This helps the company to make the consumers aware of their product in the market. When a product is newly introduced in the market, a low price is quoted, so that the buyers give it a preference over the other known items. Once, the buyers are familiar with the product and the sales increase, the discounts are taken off. This is a very lucrative method used by the companies today.\n\nNevertheless, sometimes these strategies fail. Many times people doubt the quality of the products with offers. They think that the materials used to make those items are cheap and low quality and hence do not buy it although they are available at a very low cost than the other similar products. Furthermore, people buy these items only till the offers exist and once the actual price is quoted, they think it is highly priced and hence avoid buying it. Some consumers have a liking towards a particular company product and do not buy items from other companies. This results in loss to those industries which are selling their products with offers and discounts.\n\nTo conclude, although offers and discounts increase the sales of the products, companies should also think of its reputation. They should also develop other strategies to attract consumers.",

    "question_answer": "Over-packaging of products has become a trend in today's competitive world. Producers are trying to attract consumers with an attractive packaging of their products, not bothered about its negative impact not only on our environment but the users as well. It should be the responsibility of the producers to limit the wastage of the resources in the form of unnecessary packaging.  \n\nThe cost of over packaging is actually added to the product sold. In fact, at times it is seen the packing cost and durability is more that the product itself. The type of packaging found in pharmaceutical industries can be taken as an example here. Pills and tablets are found to be packed in much bigger and colourful strips than needed. Does this increase the sale of medicine? No. Such packaging is of no concern to the consumers. But, the cost of medicine would have definitely been lesser if sold in a simple outlook.\n\nFurther, the material used is mostly non-disposable which adds to the environmental pollution to a great extent. Snacks and other food items packaged in eye-catchy shimmering coloured packets are consumed on a large scale by everybody. These packets are really difficult to dispose of as they emit poisonous gas if burnt and if not can be seen to contaminate water somewhere. Producers should realise the importance of using materials like paper and stick to simple packaging.\n\nPackaging as seen increases the cost of the product and also makes our environment unhealthy. So, this packaging boom should be checked on a serious note by the producers. Moreover, the producers should be restricted to predefined rules and parameters set by the government. It is also recommended that an awareness among the users that quality of the product is important rather than the attractive packaging.",
