    "question_text": " As a family therapist, I often have the impulse to tell families to go home and have dinner together rather than spending an hour with me. And 20 years of research in North America, Europe and Australia back up my enthusiasm for family dinners. It turns out that sitting down for a nightly meal is great for the brain, the body and the spirit. And that nightly dinner doesnt have to be a gourmet meal that took three hours to cook, nor does it need to be made with organic arugula and heirloom parsnips. For starters, researchers found that for young children, dinnertime conversation boosts vocabulary even more than being read aloud to. The researchers counted the number of rare words - those not found on a list of 3,000 most common words - that the families used during dinner conversation. Young kids learned 1,000 rare words at the dinner table, compared to only 143 from parents reading storybooks aloud. Kids who have a large vocabulary read earlier and more easily. Older children also reap intellectual benefits from family dinners. For schoolage youngsters, regular mealtime is an even more powerful predictor of high achievement scores than time spent in school, doing homework, playing sports or doing art. Other researchers reported a consistent association between family dinner frequency and teen academic performance. Adolescents who ate family meals 5 to 7 times a week were twice as likely to get A's in school as those who ate dinner with their families fewer than two times a week.",
    "question_answer": " Since family dinners can be great for the brain, the body and the spirit, for young children, dinnertime conversation boosts vocabulary more than being read aloud to, and older children also reap intellectual benefits from family dinners, so for schoolage youngsters, regular mealtime is a more powerful predictor of high achievement scores, which means adolescents who ate family meals 5 to 7 times a week were more likely to get As in school.",

In my research, beginning with a survey of 80,000 managers conducted by the Gallup Organization and continuing during the past two years with in-depth studies of a few top performers, Ive found that while there are as many styles of management as there are managers, there is one quality that sets truly great managers apart from the rest: They discover what is unique about each person and then capitalize on it. Average managers play checkers, while great managers play chess. The difference? In checkers, all the pieces are uniform and move in the same way; they are interchangeable. You need to plan and coordinate their movements, certainly, but they all move at the same pace, on parallel paths. In chess, each type of piece moves in a different way, and you cant play if you dont know how each piece moves. More important, you wont win if you dont think carefully about how you move the pieces. Great managers know and value the unique abilities and even the eccentricities of their employees, and they learn how best to integrate them into a coordinated plan of attack.\n This is the exact opposite of what great leaders do. Great leaders discover what is universal and capitalize on it. Their job is to rally people toward a better future. Leaders can succeed in this only when they can cut through differences of race, sex, age, nationality, and personality and, using stories and celebrating heroes, tap into those very few needs we all share. The job of a manager, meanwhile, is to turn one persons particular talent into performance.

    "question_title": "Categories of Living Things",
    "question_text": " It was once assumed that all living things could be divided into two fundamental and exhaustive categories. Multicellular plants and animals, as well as many unicellular organisms, are eukaryotic - their large, complex cells have a well-formed nucleus and many organelles. On the other hand, the true bacteria are prokaryotic cell, which are simple and lack a nucleus. The distinction between eukaryotes and bacteria, initially defined in terms of subcellular structures visible with a microscope, was ultimately carried to the molecular level. Here prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have many features in common. For instance, they translate genetic information into proteins according to the same type of genetic coding. But even where the molecular processes are the same, the details in the two forms are different and characteristic of the respective forms. For example, the amino acid sequences of various enzymes tend to be typically prokaryotic or eukaryotic. The differences between the groups and the similarities within each group made it seem certain to most biologists that the tree of life had only two stems. Moreover, arguments pointing out the extent of both structural and functional differences between eukaryotes and true bacteria convinced many biologists that the precursors of the eukaryotes must have diverged from the common ancestor before the bacteria arose. Although much of this picture has been sustained by more recent research, it seems fundamentally wrong in one respect. Among the bacteria, there are organisms that are significantly different both from the cells of eukaryotes and from the true bacteria, and it now appears that there are three stems in the tree of life. New techniques for determining the molecular sequence of the RNA of organisms have produced evolutionary information about the degree to which organisms are related, the time since they diverged from a common ancestor, and the reconstruction of ancestral versions of genes.

People have evolved to sleep much less than chimps, baboons or any other primates studied so far, a new study finds. Charles Nunn and David Samson are evolutionary anthropologists. They study how humans have evolved to behave the way we do. Nunn works at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Samson works at the University of Toronto Mississauga in Canada. In their new study, the two compared sleep patterns in 30 different species of primates, including humans. Most species slept between nine and 15 hours daily. Humans averaged just seven hours of shut-eye. Based on lifestyle and biological factors, however, people should get 9.55 hours, Nunn and Samson calculate. Most other primates in the study typically sleep as much as the scientists predicted they should. Nunn and Samson shared their findings online February 14 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. The researchers argue that two long-standing features of human life may play into our short sleep times. The first stems from when humans' ancestors descended from the trees to sleep on the ground. At that point, people probably had to spend more time awake to guard against predators. The second may reflect the intense pressure humans face to learn and teach new skills and to make social connections. That has left less time for sleep. As sleep declined, rapid-eye movement - or REM - sleep took on an outsize role in humans, Nunn and Samson propose. REM sleep is when we dream. And it has been linked to learning and memory. \"It's pretty surprising that non-REM sleep time is so low in humans,\" Nunn says. \"But something had to give as we slept less.\"",

    "question_text": " Banks provide short-term finance to companies in the form of an overdraft on a current account. The advantage of an overdraft is its flexibility. When the cash needs of the company increase with seasonal factors, the company can continue to write cheques and watch the overdraft increase. When the goods and services are sold and cash begins to flow in, the company should be able to watch the overdraft decrease again. The most obvious example of a business which operates in this pattern is farming. The farmer uses the overdraft to finance the acquisition of seed for arable farming, or feed through the winter for stock farming and to cover the period when the crops or animals are growing and maturing. The overdraft is reduced when the crops or the animals are sold. The main disadvantage of an overdraft is that it is repayable on demand. The farmer whose crop fails because of bad weather knows the problem of being unable to repay the overdraft. Having overdraft financing increases the worries of those who manage the company. The other disadvantage is that the interest payable on overdrafts is variable. When interest rates increase, the cost of the overdraft increases. Furthermore, for small companies there are often complaints that the rate of interest charged is high compared with that available to larger companies.

    "question_text": " Scientists have worked for many years to unravel the complex workings of the brain. Their research efforts have greatly improved our understanding of brain function. During the past decade alone, scientific and technical progress in all fields of brain research has been astonishing. Using new imaging techniques, scientists can visualize the human brain in action. Images produced by these techniques have defined brain regions responsible for attention, memory, and emotion. A series of discoveries (in multiple fields of study) has displaced the long-standing assumption that brain cells are stable and unchanging. Amazingly, new findings show that some adult brain cells can divide and grow! In addition, advances in research are allowing scientists to analyze and make progress toward understanding the causes of inherited brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Taken together, these discoveries provide hope for the recovery of nervous system function lost through injury or disease. Despite these and other significant advances in the field of brain research, most of the processes responsible for the integrated functioning of billions of brain cells remain a mystery. Research on the brain in the new millennium is crucial to our effort to come to a complete understanding of this fascinating organ. In turn, improved understanding makes the development of new treatment options possible. Research continues to bring new insights into how the brain is put together, how it works, and whether damage to the brain can be reversed.",

    "question_text": " It might seem a little eccentric but reviewing your work by reading it aloud can help to identify the woolliest areas. This works best if you perform your reading in a theatrical way, pausing at the commas and ends of sentences. If you run out of breath during a sentence, it is probably too long. You ought to be able to convert your writing into a speech in this way if it sounds too stilted and convoluted, perhaps you could rework these parts until they sound fluid. It is unlikely that your reader will be fooled by the idea that long words make you sound clever. Cluttering a sentence with too many complicated words can prevent its meaning from being understood at all. A short word is always preferable to a long one. Why should anyone choose the word erroneous over the word wrong in an essay? Usually, writers who employ more obscure words are trying to sound impressive but can appear pretentious. Direct words enable you to control what you are saying, and are not necessarily babyish, but the most appropriate ones for the job. When you read your writing aloud, you will notice that the key stress comes at the end of your sentence. It is, therefore, most effective to end with a short and emphatic word to secure our point. Try to resist the impulse to waffle at the end of your sentence by trailing off into qualifying clauses. It might be worth relocating the clause to the beginning of the sentence or losing it altogether if you feel that it adds little to its meaning. Your sentences might be the most grammatically perfect in the world, but still, cause your writing to sound wrong if you have misjudged its tone. A colloquial style, which uses slang and exclamations, is an inappropriately chatty tone for an essay.

Clients who frequented Hookham were primarily from the aristocratic or gentry classes. In fact, of Hookhams total buyers, 22% were aristocracy, and 35% of the aristocracy purchased novels. We can also confidently assume that untitled female customers were of gentry income because their addresses were primarily in London's fashionable 'West End'.\n Hookham's ledgers not only reveal a dramatic increase in the proportion of female purchasers of novels by comparison to earlier studies of provincial women, but they also reveal a remarkable increase in the proportion of female purchases of novels authored by females. Such a marked increase illustrates that Hookham's leisured female customers were able to buy more novels. Furthermore, the fact that these female aristocrats and gentry have accounts under their own name, not their husbands', demonstrates the greater degree of agency and independence that these urban, moneyed women had relative to provincial women. However, because our study does not include an examination of male customers, we are very limited in what claims we can make about whether or not these women behaved according to the clich that women were the predominant consumers of novels in the eighteenth-century.\n Moreover, while more disposable income and leisure time certainly accounts for the significant increase in female purchases of novels authored by women in the 1790s, this increase also strongly suggests a desire on the part of women readers to engage in this politically charged decade. Thus, novel-reading provided women readers with the means through which they were able to participate in the male-dominated world of politics.

    "question_text": " Skipping Breakfast Has Drawbacks - It's no mystery why so many people routinely skip breakfast: bad timing. It comes at a time when folks can be more occupied with matters of grooming, attire and otherwise making themselves presentable for a new day. However, studies conducted both in the United States and internationally have shown that skipping breakfast can affect learning, memory and physical well-being. Students who skip breakfast are not as efficient at selecting critical information for problem-solving as their peers who have had breakfast. For schoolchildren, skipping breakfast diminishes the ability to recall and use newly acquired information, verbal fluency, and control of attention, according to Ernesto Pollitt, a UC Davis professor of pediatrics whose research focuses on the influence of breakfast on mental and physical performance. Skipping breakfast can impair thinking in adults, also. For both children and adults, a simple bowl of cereal with milk goes a long way toward providing a sufficiently nutritious start to the day. GreenBurgeson recommends choosing a cereal that's low in sugar - less than five grams per serving - and using nonfat or one percent milk. Frederick Hirshburg, a pediatrician at UC Davis Medical Group, Carmichael, says that babies and other preschoolers rarely skip breakfast because \"they're usually the hungriest at the beginning of the day. Breakfast then becomes more of a learned experience than a response to a biological need, Hirshburg says.",

The more you understand and know about a situation, the more comfortable you will be and thus the less power your shyness will have over you.\n Lets take for example the subject of public speaking. This is an activity that terrifies most people half to death, but only because most people dont have much knowledge about it. If you do some research and investigation, youll come to learn that its perfectly natural to be terrified of public speaking, and that almost every single person has the same fears and insecurities that you do.\n When you take it further and ask yourself why you are so terrified of this, youll come to learn that you are scared of being judged, or of being laughed at. From there, you can go and read and learn about people who are good at public speakinglearn their tips and strategies.\n This way you are much more prepared because your knowledge on the subject is vast. As a result of this, your confidence will already be much higher than before, which might allow you to attempt public speaking when you join a club like Toastmasters. As you practice more, you will naturally become even more confident.\n This rule applies to any area where you feel insecure. Read and research as much about the topic as possible. This will help increase your confidence enough to give the activity a try to see if you might be able to become better at it. And that initial confidence to take action is all you need to get the ball rolling and overcome your shyness.",

Climatology is the study of the physical state of the atmosphere  its instantaneous state or weather, its seasonal-to-interannual variability, its long-term average condition or climate, and how climate changes over time.

The buzz is about becoming carbon-neutral, but where do you start? Consider your drivers. Do you want to become carbon-neutral for marketing reasons, for financial reasons or to help save the planet? Simon Armitage of the Carbon Neutral Company believes: \"Your drivers will help you tailor your carbon-reduction program and determine key performance indicators.\" This will help build a case for going carbon-neutral. First, measure your carbon footprint, or get a specialist to do it for you. That primarily means taking account of your energy usage and emissions caused through travel. Before you begin, think about whether you're collecting the right data and whether it's readily accessible. When implementing any energy reduction measures, ensure you engage with your staff. \"It's much better if your people decide for themselves when it's sensible for them to travel,\" says Armitage. You'll also need them to participate in switching off the lights and other energy-saving measures. Set targets and show it's not a one-off exercise.",

This means that, while we watch and wonder about other people as much as possible, we often think that people around us are less aware. This illusion occurs because, while we are fully aware of our own impressions and speculations about other people, we have no idea about what those other people are thinking unless they choose to share with us, something that rarely happens except in exceptional circumstances. To better understand what is happening, it is important to consider the groundbreaking research by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman on cognitive biases. When people make judgments about other people in social situations, they often depend on specific biases such as the availability heuristic, i.e., that we attach more significance to thoughts that come to mind easily. This is why we consider thoughts about other people as being more important than thoughts about inanimate objects. And so, as we look around us, we tend to focus our thoughts on the people we see and what they happen to be doing. Which is why people-watching can be so addictive. What adds to the sense that we are relatively invisible to others is that people tend to be as discreet as possible about their people-watching. Just because other people aren't sharing their observations with us, it's easy to pretend that they are not as observant as we are. Of course, people may share their people-watching observations with anyone they happen to be with but, for the most part, that only applies to something remarkable enough to comment on.

Most start using the internet at the average age of three  and as recent research shows, children now spend more time playing and socializing online than watching television programs. Given this change in habits, it is not surprising that a recent House of Lords report has raised online safety and behavior as an important issue. The report said that for children, learning to survive in a world dominated by the internet should be as important as reading and writing. The House of Lords Communications Committee also warned that children should not be leaving school without a well-rounded understanding of the digital world. It also suggested that the government should think about implementing new legal requirements and a code of conduct companies would have to adhere to, which would help to bring the internet up to childfriendly standards. Of course, trying to rectify this lack of child-centered design is not an easy task, but one that requires the cooperation and goodwill of many sectors. It will need to involve consultation with technology, education, legal and policy experts. And it would also be a good idea to make children and young people part of the process.",

    "question_text": "According to the theory of continental drift, the world was made up of a single continent through most of geologic time. That continent eventually separated and drifted apart, forming into the seven continents we have today. The first comprehensive theory of continental drift was suggested by the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener in 1912. The hypothesis asserts that the continents consist of lighter rocks that rest on heavier crustal materialsimilar to the manner in which icebergs float on water. Wegener contended that the relative positions of the continents are not rigidly fixed but are slowly movingat a rate of about one yard per century. \n\n According to the generally accepted plate-tectonics theory, scientists believe that Earth's surface is broken into a number of shifting slabs or plates, which average about 50 miles in thickness. These plates move relative to one another above a hotter, deeper, more mobile zone at average rates as great as a few inches per year. Most of the world's active volcanoes are located along or near the boundaries between shifting plates and are called plate-boundary volcanoes. \n\n The peripheral areas of the Pacific Ocean Basin, containing the boundaries of several plates, are dotted with many active volcanoes that form the so-called Ring of Fire. The Ring provides excellent examples of plate-boundary volcanoes, including Mount St. Helens. \n\n However, some active volcanoes are not associated with plate boundaries, and many of these so-called intra-plate volcanoes form roughly linear chains in the interior of some oceanic plates. The Hawaiian Islands provide perhaps the best example of an intra-plate volcanic chain, developed by the northwest-moving Pacific plate passing over an inferred hot spot that initiates the magma-generation and volcano-formation process.",

    "question_text": "As warmer winter temperatures become more common, one way for some animals to adjust is to shift their ranges northward. But a new study of 59 North American bird species indicates that doing so is not easy or quick -- it took about 35 years for many birds to move far enough north for winter temperatures to match where they historically lived\n The researchers used 35 years of data from the North American Christmas Bird Count to match winter temperatures to where birds were seen. They tested 59 bird species individually and found that they responded differently to climate change. When summarized across bird species, there was evidence for a strong delay lasting about 35 years.\n For example, black vultures have spread northward in the last 35 years and now winter as far north as Massachusetts, where the minimum winter temperature is similar to what it was in Maryland in 1975. On the other hand, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker did not alter its range at all despite the warming trend, possibly because its very specific habitat requirements precluded a range shift.\n Both of these scenarios could represent problems for birds, La Sorte said. Species that do not track changes in climate may wind up at the limits of their physiological tolerance, or they may lose important habitat qualities, such as favored food types, as those species pass them by. But they also can't move their ranges too fast if the habitat conditions they depend on also tend to lag behind climate.\n If warming trends weaken, as they did over the past few years, birds may be able to catch up. But accelerated warming, which is likely as global carbon emissions continue to increase, may put additional strain on birds. The study highlights these challenges and the high potential climate change has for disrupting natural systems. It also underscores the challenges ecologists face in predicting the long-term consequences of climate change for many species simultaneously.",

    "question_text": "Malaysia is one of the most pleasant, hassle-free countries to visit in Southeast Asia. Aside from its gleaming 21st century glass towers, it boasts some of the most superb beaches, mountains and national parks in the region. Malaysia is also launching its biggest-ever tourism campaign in an effort to lure 20 million visitors here this year.\nAny tourist itinerary would have to begin in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, where you will find the Petronas Twin Towers, which once comprised the world's tallest buildings and now hold the title of the second-tallest. Both the 88-story towers soar 1,480 feet high and are connected by a sky-bridge on the 41st floor. The limestone temple Batu Caves, located 9 miles north of the city, have a 328-foot-high ceiling and feature ornate Hindu shrines, including a 141-foot-tall gold- painted statue of a Hindu deity. To reach the caves, visitors have to climb a steep flight of 272 steps. In Sabah state on Borneo island not to be confused with Indonesia's Borneo, you'll find the small mushroom-shaped Sipadan island, off the coast of Sabah, rated as one of the top five diving sites in the world. Sipadan is the only oceanic island in Malaysia, rising from a 2,300-foot abyss in the Celebes Sea. \nYou can also climb Mount Kinabalu, the tallest peak in Southeast Asia, visit the Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary, go white-water rafting and catch a glimpse of the bizarre Proboscis monkey, a primate found only in Borneo with a huge pendulous nose, a characteristic pot belly and strange honking sounds. While you're in Malaysia, consider a trip to Malacca. In its heyday, this southern state was a powerful Malay sultanate and a booming trading port in the region. Facing the Straits of Malacca, this historical state is now a place of intriguing Chinese streets, antique shops, old temples and reminders of European colonial powers. Another interesting destination is Penang, known as the Pearl of the Orient. This island off the northwest coast of Malaysia boasts of a rich Chinese cultural heritage, good food and beautiful beaches.",

Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott draw on a 2009 study to show that if the trend continues, more than half the babies born in wealthier countries since 2000 may reach their 100th birthdays. With a few simple, devastating strokes, Gratton and Scott show that under the current system it is almost certain you wont be able to save enough to fund several decades of decent retirement. For example, if your life expectancy is 100, you want a pension that is 50 percent of your final salary, and you save 10 percent of your earnings each year, they calculate that you wont be able to retire till your 80s. People with 100-year life expediencies must recognize they are in for the long haul, and make an early start arranging their lives accordingly.\n  \n But how to go about this? Gratton and Scott advance the idea of a multistage life, with repeated changes of direction and attention. Material and intangible assets will need upkeep, renewal or replacement.

None of the cities where people most want to live such as London, New York, Paris and Hong Kong comes near to being at the top of surveys asking which are best to live in.\n The top three in the most recent Economist Intelligence Units livability ranking, for example, were Melbourne, Vancouver and Vienna. They are all perfectly pleasant, but great? The first question to tackle is the difference between livability and greatness. Perhaps we cannot aspire to make a great city, but if we attempt to make a livable one, can it in time become great?\n There are some fundamental elements that you need. The first is public space. Whether it is Viennas Ringstrasse and Prater park, or the beaches of Melbourne and Vancouver, these are places that allow the city to pause and the citizens to mingle and to breathe, regardless of class or wealth.

Allowances give children a chance to experience the things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want.

The fossil record shows that throughout their 160 million year existence, dinosaurs took on a huge variety of forms as the environment changed and new species evolved that were suited to these new conditions. Others that failed to adapt went extinct. But then 66 million years ago, over a relatively short time, dinosaurs disappeared completely (except for birds). Many other animals also died out, including pterosaurs, large marine reptiles, and other sea creatures such as ammonites.

Consequently, India is able to do both jobs at a lower dollar cost than in the United States: India has an absolute advantage in both.

While India may have an absolute advantage in both activities, that fact is irrelevant in determining what India or the United States will produce. India has comparative advantage in doing programming in part because such activity requires little capital. The flip side is that the United States has a comparative advantage in technology innovation partly because it is relatively easy to obtain capital in this country to undertake such long-run projects.

While the IPCCs estimates and conclusions are grounded in careful study, Gore doesn't seem to be similarly restrained.\nGore told the world in his Academy Award-winning movie (recently labelled \"one-sided\" and containing \"scientific errors\" by a British judge) to expect 20-foot-sea-level rises over this century. He ignores the findings of his Nobel co-winners, the IPCC, who conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot. That's similar to what the world experienced over the past 150 years.\nLikewise, Gore agonizes over the accelerated melting of ice in Greenland and what it means for the planet, but overlooks the IPCCs conclusion that, if sustained, the current rate of melting would add just three inches to the sea level rise by the end of the century. Gore also takes no notice of research showing that Greenland's temperatures were higher in 1941 than they are today.\nGore also frets about the future of polar bears. He claims they are drowning as their icy habitat disappears. However, the only scientific study showing any such thing indicates that four polar bears drowned because of a storm.\nThe politician turned movie maker loses sleep over a predicted rise in heat-related deaths. There's another side of the story that's inconvenient to mention: rising temperatures will reduce the number of cold spells, which are a much bigger killer than heat. The best study shows that by 2050, heat will claim 400,000 more lives, but 1.8 million fewer will die because of cold. Indeed, according to the first complete survey of the economic effects of climate change for the world, global warming will actually save lives.",

Various types of fairs, from local agricultural shows to Worlds Fairs, were used as instruments of hegemony to support imperialism, to promote burgeoning capitalist endeavors, and to shape class identities, social spaces and public spaces. Visual culture and the art of display became essential in defining aspects of national distinction. Colonial nations in particular, such as Canada and Australia, were attempting to develop distinct national identities to differentiate themselves from British imperial power. Agricultural fairs in North America originated at the beginning of the nineteenth century and were devoted to educating practicing framers in ways of improving their cultivation of livestock and crops through the use of various technologies.\n In 1822, the RAS was created on the premise that was a dire need in Australia for the development of improved farming skills to better support growing urban populations and export markets. Organizations based on agricultural improvement, which were popular in Britain, provided camaraderie as well as political and financial support for their members. Once transferred to the colonies, in this case Australia, they played an integral part in converting and organizing land for colonial purposes.",

But it's less straightforward to attach a date to a particular ring in an ancient Anasazi wooden beam, because at first you don't know in what year the beam was cut. Hence the sequence of the rings in a tree cross-section is like a message in Morse code formerly used for sending telegraph messages; dot-dot-dash-dot-dash in the Morse code, wide-wide-narrow-wide-narrow in the tree ring sequence. (Actually, the tree ring sequence is even more diagnostic and richer in information than the Morse code, because trees actually contain rings spanning much different width, rather than the Morse code choice between dot and dash.)\n \n Tree ring specialists (known as dendrochronologists) proceed by noting the sequence of wider and narrower rings in a tree cut down in a known recent year, and also noting the sequences in beams from trees cut down at various times in the past. In that way, dendrochronologists have constructed tree ring records extending back for thousands of years in some parts of the world.

The researcher, affiliated with both the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington, says the desire to protect the ocean can sometimes harm the people who rely on it. In a new paper, he and his co-authors call for a marine conservation code of conduct.\n \nWe don't usually think of conservation efforts doing harm, but Bennett says intentionally or unintentionally, it happens. It's \"the robbing of either marine resources or areas of the sea or the coast from the people to whom it belongs,\" he says. Examples include failing to consult with indigenous people before slapping restrictions on their subsistence fishing, or impacting local cultures by inhibiting traditional activities. In some more egregious instances, it could mean ejecting people from their homes or even limiting, or completely preventing, their access to the coast.\n \nThe sea can thank the United Nations for recent upticks in global marine protection. In 2010, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity put forward a series of biodiversity goals called the Aichi targets. Target 11 says that each country would commit to protecting 10 percent of its coastal and marine areas by 2020. As the deadline approaches, efforts around the world are ramping up. And Bennett says in Canada, the situation is complex, with areas of the coast being set aside not only for conservation, but also for oil and gas exploration, shipping, and fishing.

    "question_text": "In the porous rocks deep beneath the war-torn Gaza Strip a battle for territory is underway. Along the coast, the Mediterranean Sea is percolating through the sand, encroaching on an underground freshwater reservea salty invader poisoning the main source of drinking water for more than a million people.\n Gazans are drawing too heavily from their aquifer, a mismanagement that destabilizes the balance of power between salt and fresh water. As a result, the sea is seeping inland.\n Ostensibly this subterranean dispute is being fought by the forces of nature, yet as Josie Glausiusz writes in \"Land Divided, Coast United\", the fate of the region's water supply is intricately linked to the human struggles in Gaza and the jurisdictional wrangling that results. Gazans are not the only people facing saltwater intrusion. However, It's a global issue, and one that will likely get worse as sea levels rise.\n There are ways of staving off intrusion. In 1951, the Los Angeles County Flood Control District implemented a fix. By pumping water into a well situated between an aquifer and the sea, they created an underground wall of high-pressure water that prevents saltwater from pushing landward. But the fix comes at a cost.\n Today, California spends some $5 million a year maintaining these high-pressure water walls in just one region. More than just the financial cost, this strategy requires water to work, the very resource that is becoming more precious by the day. Given that it's the overuse of fresh water that's allowing the sea to seep in in the first place, it's not exactly an ideal solution.\n In Gaza and elsewhere, preventing the contamination of crucial coastal aquifers is a complex problemand with the sea level rising, it's not getting any easier.",

Do not copy.\n\nGlobal warming is one of the major discussed issues among us. Over the past few decades, global warming has become a serious threat to our planet. What we can do to help the environment? \nTo begin with, we should reuse, renew and recycle things. This means that we should try to save everything we use like papers, cans, water bottles and old books by putting them in recycling bins which are all around Canada. Furthermore, we need educate our fellow people on the importance of recycling and reducing the usage of plastic. \nAnother way of saving environment is by using renewable materials such as solar powers, windmills and water mills. For example, using a solar powered car instead of one with gas. And walking to near place instead of using a car. The use of fossil fuels is also very effective as it reduces the use of harmful fuels such as petroleum and diesel as they harm atmosphere around us.\nMeanwhile, we should consider influence of consumerism, which means people buy and throw away too many things. Increasing for production is the result of consumerism. The more we buy products such as paper, the more we need in industries. When people shop, they tend to throw out most of the things they come back with, and this produce massive amount of waste.",
    "question_answer": " \nGlobal warming is a serious situation and there are things we can do to help. Firstly, we should reuse, renew and recycle things we use. Secondly, we should use more renewable energy and use less private vehicles. Finally, we can reduce the impact of consumerism by buying less products.",

Locked below decks in a smuggler's fishing trawler, hundreds drowned when their would-be escort crashed into a merchant ship.\n In the past year, smugglers have sent hundreds of thousands of African migrants onto the open sea for a harrowing crossing to Europe. Rampant poverty, war, religious persecution, and political instability have many Africans and Middle Easterners searching for safer shores. Though many migrants make the crossing safely, thousands have died. The migrant crisis is exposing a lot of cracks, including the flaws in a set of laws that was built atop an ancient honor code.\n When on the open sea the threat of death always looms, and this harsh reality is the source of one of the oldest humanitarian codes: if you find people in distress at sea, you must save them if you can.\n It's a tradition that goes back centuries, if not millennia, says David Jardine-Smith, company secretary of the International Maritime Rescue Foundation. Though the origins of the code are \"lost in the mists of time.\"\n \"Throughout history and still today, particularly in the open sea, the only rescue possible is another ship in the area,\" he says.\n Over time, this informal sailors' code has been chiseled into the formal laws in many nations. In 1982, the United Nations established the \"duty to render assistance\" as part of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The law stands out because, in essence, it amounts to a legal right to be saved.\n The law turns every ship in international watersevery fishing vessel, cargo ship, or cruise shipinto an obligatory savior whose failure to act is a legal offense.",
    "question_answer": " Thousands of people have died trying to cross the sea from Africa to Europe, escaping their country for safer shores, however, it is showing cracks in the law and an old honor code to save those at sea since there is a law that obligates every boat to be a rescuer and failing to act is illegal.\n\n ",

    "question_text": "Dive tourism is a pillar of the economy in Cozumel, an island off Mexico's southern coast. But the reefs that keep this industry standing are being destroyed by invasive lionfish, which eat native fish and slowly but persistently strip the reefs of their vibrancy and diversity. Such sorely degraded reefs will hurt Cozumels tourism industryto the tune of a 12 percent drop in tourists, or US $83-million annually, according to a recent report conducted by Mexico's National Commission of Protected Areas. But controlling the lionfish is expensive. Hunting them one by one with harpoons is the best method, but there aren't enough local resources to fund such a cull.\n To make up the financial shortfall, some conservationists and scientists have suggested levying a fee on divers to help pay for reef protection. In a new paper, Luis Malpica Cruz, a marine scientist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, shows that implementing such a fee could involve some tough choices. He found that most tourists would be willing to pay a $5 fee, but were less likely to pay more. He also found that most tourists prefer healthy reefs with few lionfish. The takeaway of the study is that in the short term, such a fee could discourage divers from visiting Cozumel, hurting local businesses.

    "question_text": "The 2017 North Atlantic hurricane season still has about five weeks to go, but it's already one of the most expensive on record.\n According to Gavin Magor, a senior financial analyst at rating agency Weiss Ratings, claims on damages caused by Hurricane Harvey will cost from US $160- to $190-billion, and Irma will cost $50- to $60-billion. This toll makes the two storms more expensive than 2005, when four hurricanes caused $143-billion in damages. It's just as bad for some of the islands in the Caribbean, with an early estimate putting the damage from Irma at $10- to $13-billion, the most expensive storm on record in the region.\n Such massive expenses force the question: can the United States afford to take another hit?\n Private insurers and reinsurers (companies that insure insurers), for their part, have deep enough pockets to pay out Harvey and Irma claims. After the busy hurricane season of 2004, and the devastation wrought by Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and other storms in 2005the cost of which caused some insurers to foldthe past 12 years have been relatively quiet. This has allowed the remaining companies to restock.\n Franklin Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, points out that after those costly hurricane seasons, new investors brought money into the system. In fact, competition in the market has pushed the cost for reinsurance 46 percent lower than it was in 2004. \"It's classic economics,\" Nutter says.\n Despite the built-up reserves, insurers could still be brought down. \"The system is capable of weathering a couple of mid-sized storms,\" Magor says, but cautions that if a Category 4 or 5 storm hits in the wrong place, all bets are off.",

Music can activate the brain's reward centre, leaving you feeling happy and relaxed. It can also improve thought processes, boost performance and enhance reading and memory skills. Music is also used to treat anxiety and insomnia, lower blood pressure, soothe patients suffering dementia and relax babies. \n According to researchers at the Center for Music Research at Florida State University, lullabies played to premature infants in an intensive care unit resulted in more rapid weight gain and a quicker discharge from hospital, compared to babies not exposed to the music (Standley 1998). \n Music training can also create changes in our brain. In a study conducted by Gaser and Schlaug (2003), the motor auditory, visual, spatial cortexes were larger in professional musicians compared to non-musicians. \n A well-publicized study by researchers at the University of California in 1993 suggested that listening to Mozart could boost cognitive performance  the 'Mozart effect'. Whilst the idea remains popular with some people, the study has been widely criticized. Meditation also has positive effects on the brain.

In spite of the fact that it initially developed plentifully on the west coast of India, it has since spread to numerous nations. Today, Indonesia creates more than 80 percent of all developed pepper. It also develops in the wild, yet the majority is cultivated in plantations. \n\n The development of pepper is a mind boggling process. Agriculturists must trim, treat and water the pepper plants to get great yields, and it takes three years for a bush to create berries. At first, the organic product is green. It is actually picked when it is as still unripe, as this is when it has the strongest taste; If left to age, it would turn yellow and afterward red. Laborers spread the berries out in baskets and leave them to dry under the hot sun. The sun's heat turns the berries black, and they are then ground into the fine pepper we use for cooking. \n\n There are many other varieties of spice other than pepper. For instance, ginger originates from the base of the ginger plant. It can be developed in a pot at home, or all the more usually, in carefully developed plantations around the globe. When added to tea, it soothes coughs and colds. It can be thinly cut and cooked with meat or fish, utilized as a part of curries and pickles, and even utilized as a tonic for pregnant ladies. Spices certainly make food all the more intriguing and tasty, and fill other helpful needs.",

Nature is often defined in this debate as genetic or hormone-based behaviours, while nurture is most commonly defined as environment and experience.\n \n The nature vs. nurture debate is an ongoing one. The modern debate often centres around the effect genes have on human personalities as opposed to the influences that early environment and development might have. As cultural morals have changed, so have popular understandings of this debate. In the 1960s, for example, psychologistsand pop culture in generalwere heavily influenced by the theories of behaviourism. This theory led to the widespread belief that human personality is primarily influenced by experience and training.

    "question_text": "Youngsters are spending more cash than any other time in recent memory. Simply a year ago, 31.6 million adolescents burned through 155 billion, as indicated by the North-stream, Illinois-based statistical surveying bunch Teenage Research Unlimited. Quite a bit of that cash, obviously, originates from parents. Shocked at the amount of cash kids spend? Perhaps you haven't checked the prices recently on a portion of what these teenagers want. \n To a few, such extreme spending on the famously fickle youth may appear to be over the top. For what reason do a few parents give in? One factor is most likely the sheer energy of promoting through mass media. As per the group Adbusters, young people are presented with an expected 3,000 advertisements every day. Join the advertisements with programming itself, similar to the design, music-and skin-filled shows on MTV, and you have a torrent of messages telling children what they should own if they want to fit in. \"The weight on parents today are tremendous,\" says Tom Vogele, a single parent of twin 18-year-old young ladies in Newport Beach, Calif. \"I really trust it is harder today to bring up teenagers without spoiling them, not on account of parents are less fit or lazy, but rather on the grounds that such a significant number of forces are working against me.\" \n Many working parents most likely compensate by burning through cash on their children, says Timothy Marshall, a partner teacher of formative brain research at Christopher Newport University in Virginia. For a few, there is likely some blame engaged with not investing enough energy at home. In any case, Marshall states, \"Burning through cash is frequently more helpful in our quick paced society than going to baseball games or different exercises.\"",
    "question_answer": " Teenagers are spending more of their parents' money than ever since they want more expensive items nowadays, which is due to many advertisements adolescents are exposed to daily; although it is harder for parents to not spoil their children from many forces working against them, buying things for their kids is easier and more convenient than spending time with them.\n\n ",

    "question_text": "Mass transportation changed the social and financial structure of the American city in three main ways. It catalyzed physical expansion, it dealt with individuals and land uses, and it quickened the innate instability of urban life. By opening large zones of vacant land for private development, the omnibuses, horse railroads, passenger trains, and electric trolleys pulled settled areas outward two to four times more removed from downtown areas than they were in the pre-modern day period. In 1850, for instance, the fringes of Boston lay barely two miles from the old business locale; by the turn of the century, the sweep broadened ten miles. Presently the individuals who could manage the cost of it could live far expelled from the old downtown area and still drive there for work, shopping, and entertainment.

Beethoven lived in the time of rising free enterprise. Around then, individuals were attempting to break the shackles of feudalism, and they were seeking freedom, fairness, and universal love.
