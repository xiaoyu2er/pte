And this is exactly what broadband is, you know which direction it's coming from, you know {#4} which side of you it's coming from. Alarms at the moment are so loud that they actually {#5} you. If youre at a set of {#6} lights, you don't know which direction an {#7}, a police car or a fire engine may be coming from, but with broadband you do.\n\n You automatically turn towards it; it has to be safer because you can then get out of the way very quickly. It sounds just like a \"shush shush\" sound. The alarms you hear at the moment are very rich in tones. But the broadband isn't. Because it's not got the tonal content, you know where that sound is coming from. And the nicer thing about broadband is as soon as it's gone by, it disappears, you don't actually hear it.\n Broadband noise alarms are being used in a number of places around the country.
