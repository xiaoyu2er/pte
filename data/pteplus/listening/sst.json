In the 1950 paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation with unseen players and evaluates their response. To pass the test, a computer must be able to replace one of the players without substantially changing the results. In other words, a computer would be considered intelligent if its conversation couldnt be easily distinguished from a humans.

    "question_text": "I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation, sharing some of the problems. And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that -- being honest about what was going well, what wasn't, and making it kind of an annual thing. A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand. But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist. Any tough problem, I think it can be solved. And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. Over the last century, average lifespan has more than doubled. Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths. As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. It's a phenomenal thing. Each one of those lives matters a lot.",

Thirdly, it is essential for great ideas to be transformative and productive. All ideas are essentially a combination of other smaller ideas, but this doesnt mean they cant be unique. Merely copying doesnt make anything idiosyncratic, its the individuality that one puts in which makes a concept stand out. Constant innovation leaves no room for stagnation and thus, adds on to the basic idea, effectively making it unique.

Carnegie always did well at whatever he set his mind to. He was known to make improvements to any job he held. While working for the telegraph office, he began studying the railroad system, and he soon became the superintendent. He took the money he had saved and invested in an oil company. His investment return was good and then he went to England to learn how to make steel. He wanted to make steel that was cheaper and more durable than American steel. He came back with his knowledge and built a huge steel factory. Carnegie's Factory was very successful and he sold it for 480 million dollars. Carnegie was a very wealthy man but he was more interested in philanthropy than spending his money on himself. He spent the rest of his life giving his money away to worthy causes. Reading and learning were very important to him, so he built many libraries. He also established universities and research institutes. Carnegie built hospitals, museums, and theaters. One of the most recognizable buildings he built was Carnegie Hall in New York City. Carnegie Hall hosts many concerts and symphonies each year and is an important part of New York City culture. Andrew Carnegie passed away at the age of 83. In his lifetime he gave away 90% of his fortune. He is known as a man who was selfless and wanted to do good for others.",

Then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be. We decided upon chimpanzees. We know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have, and they also resemble the kind that human beings have. And so, we chose chimpanzees, and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition. So now we needed to find our chimpanzee. Our chimpanzee, first we found two of them in the state of New York. Both of them would die before we could even get our suits filed. Then we found Tommy. Tommy is a chimpanzee. Tommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that cage. We found him in a small room that was filled with cages in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York. And so, on the last week of December 2013, the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three suits all across the state of New York using the same common law argument. The court didn't approve our appeal because they think chimpanzees are not humans even though they have cognitive skills. We proved to the court that chimpanzees also have cognitive capacities, and they were not hearing us. We wanted the chimpanzees out, and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps, a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary in South Florida which involves an artificial lake with 12 or 13 islands -- there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them.

    "question_text": "The design of buildings is important according to architectural textbooks. At its roots, architecture exists to create the physical environment in which people live, but architecture is more than just the built environment, its also a part of our culture. It stands as a representation of how we see ourselves, as well as how we see the world. There are poorly designed buildings, but also some great building works. In the Victorian Era, architects designed buildings based on bricks and other materials. The design of flaws was based on lighting as it would not only affect appearance but also health conditions. The materials that buildings are made of also matter. For example, the design of ground floors must ensure that the building is able to withstand the weight of the higher levels. In the 20th century, many old buildings with design flaws were demolished or modified through a natural selection process, which means they are an altered state rather than an original state. This is an application of Darwin's theory of natural selection to modification of old buildings, which means buildings should adapt to the new world to survive or be pulled down.

And that's what I do as a practicing mathematician. I spend my life trying to understand what symmetries are possible, in nature and in mathematics and abstractly. And here I've got a connection, going back 5,000 years, to people who are already trying to understand  how can I arrange patches on the side of these stone balls in a symmetrical manner? One of the intriguing things about these stones is that we don't actually know what they're for. They might have been for divination trying to predict the future. They might have been part of a game. They look very much like dice, but we don't really think there is any game associated with them. Maybe they were just for chucking around, they're very nice in the hand when you hold them.\nOr maybe they were symbols of power in the clan. I suppose that's why I like them because we don't really know what they are. If I had a theory about why they were doing this it would be that actually, they were starting to be mathematicians, and that here we see the first example of abstract thought at work.

    "question_title": "luxury brand",
    "question_text": "The question today of what makes a luxury brand and how do we distinguish it is very hard to answer. The standard business response is to say they are more exclusive. And we get exclusivity by having high prices and relatively small amounts of the product available. The reality, however, of luxury brands is that they are sold in their millions, and in some cases, are not priced that much higher than the standard output. The only way I can really answer your question is to say it is all relative. As you said in your introduction, it wasn't that long ago in Australia that we would have considered two televisions to be a luxury, or even further back, one color television. And you can make a strong argument, for example, that Starbucks in China, right now, is a luxury purchase because of its cost, because of how frequently it is purchased by many people. So, I think the long answer is a complicated one, but the answer is  it depends on whom you talk to. I think in the business community, what we would say is that there is a small cluster of more expensive brands which have a distinct strategy that we would identify as being luxury brands. And they start with the Rolls Royce and the Tiffanys and the Louis Vuittons of the world. And, l think that tends to be how we see them.",

We don't exactly understand where they come from, or what actually makes them. And there's a lot of open questions that we really don't have an answer for. There are probably more theories about what makes fast radio bursts, than there are actual detections of these things. So since 2007, we've only had 20, but there are probably 30 or 40 different theories on what makes them. The most interesting thing about this bust is the fact that we found it with the Australian square kilometre array pathfinder. So that is, it wasn't really obvious that we would be able to do this, as well as we ended up being able to do it. So this telescope is really a fantastic telescope. In fact, it's probably the best telescope on the planet at the moment for finding these busts.

    "question_text": "In my view, it's impossible not to talk about wildlife, and not think about its role in livelihood. And I guess part of that is my own view, part of the research that I do in Africa. In most East and West Africa, I look at this role. \nAll humans rely on wildlife as their source of food, and also their source of income. And we when talk about wildlife, it seems we are talking about fish - we are talking about what probably is the single most important source of protein for humans across the globe. And so billions, or more than a billion people, rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein, and most of these people live in poverty. So the management of fish resources in wildlife in that sense is incredibly important to livelihoods and health.\nAnd also, wildlife tourism is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and in many places, such as Africa, south America, it can be the number one source of income - the number one source of foreign income for economies.",

Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100-150 m.

As the sea levels rose again at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10,000 years ago, the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass.

So we have a fault plane and the earthquake is so focus on this fault plane and the earthquake starts at the particular point on the fault plane and we call that the focus of the earthquake.

We have had 15 years more or less of an uninterrupted economic growth during which average earning has been raised by close to 90 percent. While over the course of that period, the standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved. That meant that the amount which a typical home buying house hold can afford to borrow under rules which aren't strictly applied as they used to be had more than doubled.

English, in fact, has borrowed from over 350 languages in its history. So it's a variety of many languages. Some people say it's like a dog, a mongrel dog, a dog that has been made up of many different dogs. The English language is like that. By looking at the history of the English language we learn about the history of the English people. The two things are closely connected. So, in fact, today we are not only learning about language but we are learning about history. The fact that English has borrowed words from over 350 languages has been viewed differently throughout history. So for example in Shakespeare's time people were very angry about words which were not, they thought, original English words - words which came from other languages, they didn't like them.",

Chemically the process of generating water, which is basically taking hydrogen and oxygen and burning them to produce water, is not a process that happens a lot any more. So in terms of our total volume of water in the world, yes it is changing, but its not changing significantly relative to the rate at which we are using or demand fresh new water.\nNow there are a lot of different areas of technology involved in water recycling, and we are later in the interview going to get to industrial use and the reclamation of sewerage. What about in the home at the moment; what sort of technology is being utilised in the home when we talk about water recycling? Well very little on average. Typically in a modern home we turn on the tap, we take a glass of water, we probably in turning on that tap flush ten glasses of water down the sink. We take a shower, we use fresh water, we do a whole range of things, and there is nominally very little recycling of that. It goes down the drain and it goes off to a wastewater treatment plant. There is actually very, very little recycling at a local level.

In fact, he was quite concerned about the way music could either degrade or elevate the minds of young people. So, you can see, in some sense, nothing has changed. He said rhythm and harmony find their ways into the inward places of soul. Well, yes, that's true and he said this in 400 B.C. But what has changed since then? It's just in the last few years, brain science has started to seriously investigate music and this young science is confirming music's power over us. For example, some colleagues in Montreal decided to do a study to investigate what happens in the brain when people get chills to music. This is intense emotional responses that often manifest themselves as shivers tingling of the spines. Anybody here had this? OK, it's not uncommon. And they specifically looked at chills to instrumental music. So this wasn't due to any associations that people had with lyrics. It was just sounds of music. And they took advantage of the fact that people often know quite well what music gives them chills they know the piece, sometimes the very passage in the piece and so they had people bring in their own self-selected CDs and they scan their brains while they were having these experiences listening to music.",

Instincts are also often discussed in relation to motivation since they can also occur in response to an organism's need to satisfy some innate internal drive tied to survival. Instincts are present across species and are consistent within individual species. In other words, many different species rely on instincts, and if one member of a species possesses an instinct, then they all do. Before we move into a discussion of specific types of instincts, it is important to distinguish the difference between an instinct and a reflex. Both are types of unlearned behavior that tend to serve a survival purpose. The difference is that a reflex is a typically a simple reaction or a response to an environmental trigger whereas an instinct is a much more complex set of behaviors.\nFor instance, an example of a reflex would be when a baby turns his head toward an object that is pressed against one cheek in an effort to nurse. The head turn is a simple reactionary process. An instinct would be the manner in which a mother bird regurgitates her food to feed her young in response to their signals of hunger.",

So I always ask the question, \"what would you like to do if money were no object? How would you really enjoy spending your life?\" Its so amazing as a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say: - Well, wed like to be painters. - Wed like to be poets. - Wed like to be writers. - I'd like to live outdoors life and ride horses. But everybody knows you cant earn any money that way! When we finally get down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him, you do that and forget the money! Because, if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. Youll be doing things you dont like doing in order to go on living. That is to go on doing things you dont like doing. Which is stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what youre doing, it doesnt matter what it is, you can eventually become a master of it. And then youll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is.

For many people, language acquisition starts around about twelve months when kids say that first word, but don't forget the first year. At the first year, our first year of life is very important as well and indeed before you are born, remember there are couple of months before you are born, when you actually able to perceive in the womb, something of the language that's around you. So language acquisition starts earlier than most people think. And it also ends later than most people think. When does child language acquisition stop? Well, in a sense, you know, we are all children, we stay being children all in our lives. There is no obvious endpoint for learning sounds, of course, there is for learning grammar, there is for vocabulary, huh. I mean that goes on for the rest of our lives in million or more words in English.

Chemically the process of generating water, which is basically taking hydrogen and oxygen and burning them to produce water, is not a process that happens a lot anymore. So in terms of our total volume of water in the world, yes it is changing, but its not changing significantly relative to the rate at which we are using or demand fresh new water. Now there are a lot of different areas of technology involved in water recycling, and we are later in the interview going to get to industrial use and the reclamation of sewerage. What about in the home at the moment; what sort of technology is being utilized in the home when we talk about water recycling? Well very little on average. Typically in a modern home, we turn on the tap, we take a glass of water, we probably in turning on that tap flush ten glasses of water down the sink. We take a shower, we use fresh water, we do a whole range of things, and there is nominally very little recycling of that. It goes down the drain and it goes off to a wastewater treatment plant. There is actually very, very little recycling at a local level. People dont actually say well Im now going to take the water I just used, put it through a sophisticated process and reuse it and have a closed loop. Its not a closed loop in the home.",

Sure, you can see examples here of the wheel or the automobile, but the inventions I'm talking about are the domestic appliances that allowed for increased leisure time and redefined gender roles in society. To a degree as never seen before in human history, the evolution of the washing machine as demonstrated in this barn is a representative example of this changing domestic life. For many centuries, sailors used to place their clothing in a cloth bag, tie the back to a rope and throw it overboard, letting the ship drag it for hours. The principle was simple: force water through the clothes to remove the dirt. But in the household before running water and electricity washing clothes took a staggering amount of labor. To wash, boil and rinse a single load of clothes could take 50 gallons of water, which had to be hand carried from a pump or well. Pan wringing rubbing and lifting the clothes could expose women to caustic substances in the soaps. The whole process for a households laundry could take an entire day or more of back-breaking labor. In 1846, a patented washing machine imitated the human hand moving cloth over a washboard by using a lever to rub the clothes between two rib surfaces. This machine was sold in the U.S. as late as 1927. The first electric clothes washers in which a motor rotated the tub were introduced into America about 1900.",

A lot of people who study law at university do so because they want to become practicing lawyers, whether barristers of solicitors. But it is not necessary to read law at university to become a practicing lawyer. Equally, studying law at university is a legitimate subject for academic study even if you definitely do not want to become a lawyer or think that you may not become a practicing lawyer. That is because the study of law at university is not a vocational subject, it is an academic subject and an intellectual discipline. Even those students who study law at university intending to become practicing lawyers are required to do additional vocational training to prepare them for working either as a barrister or a solicitor; for them the study of law at university by itself is not sufficient to train them to become lawyers. So why do such students study law at university and why do others study law even if they dont want to become a lawyer? The answer is fairly similar in both cases, namely that studying law at university trains the student to think and write logically and clearly.",

Communication is the process of transmitting information from one person to another. Information is a pattern of data organized in a particular way. For example, a sentence consists of symbols that form words in a particular language with a particular meaning. The sentence also utilizes grammar, which is a recognized way to structure words forming a sentence. Noise is any type of disturbance that interferes with the interpretation of the information. Some argue that noise exists in all communication.\nSemantic noise doesnt involve sound but rather ambiguity in words, sentences or other symbols used in communication. The ambiguity is caused because everybody sees a different meaning in the same words, phrases or sentences.

Late last year the NOC led an expedition on the RRS James Cook that found enough of the scarce element Tellurium present in the crust of a submerged volcano that, if it were all to be used in the production of solar PV panels, could provide two-thirds of the UKs annual electricity supply. Recently, the NOC also led an international study demonstrating deep-sea nodule mining will cause long-lasting damage to deep-sea life, lasting at least for decades. These nodules are potato-sized rocks containing high levels of metals, including copper, manganese and nickel. They grow very slowly on the sea-bed, over millions of years. Although no commercial operations exist to extract these resources, many are planned. Professor Edward Hill, Executive Director at the NOC commented, By 2050 there will be nine billion people on earth and attention is increasingly turning to the ocean, particularly the deep ocean, for food, clean supplies of energy and strategic minerals. The NOC is undertaking research related to many aspects and perspectives involved in exploiting ocean resources. This research is aimed at informing with sound scientific evidence the decisions that will need to be taken in the future, as people increasingly turn to the oceans to address some of societys greatest challenges.",

Temperatures plummeted, rain levels fell and a massive ice sheet slowly advanced to cover most of northern Europe and stay there for the next few thousand years. We know that during this glacial period, many animal and plant species sought shelter in Europes three warmer southern peninsulas, Iberia, Italy, and the Balkans. But the questions is, where did the people go? Archeological material recovered from this time period has shown that a large number of our ancestors retreated to Franco Cantabria, an area covering the southwest of France and the northeastern tip of Spain. But was this the only area where people traveled to escape the worst of the weather? Lets go back to the growing ice sheet. In order to grow, the ice mass had to take up water, causing sea levels to fall. At its maximum when the ice reached as far south as Germany, sea levels were up to 120 meters lower than today. Thats approximately the same height as the London Eye. As a result, areas of the shallow sea became exposed and Europes shape was very different from the one we recognized. It could be that humans lived on these exposed shores during the Paleolithic, but we have no evidence of their settlements because its now underwater.",

    "question_text": "Ever try to get a baby to smile? It can seem close to impossible - and then suddenly there it is: that elusive, seemingly joyous grin. Well it turns out those smiles arent spontaneous - theyre strategic. \nResearchers have found that when babies smile, it's for a reason. They want whoever theyre interacting with - typically a parent - to smile back. And they time it just so, a smile here and a smile there. The researchers call it sophisticated timing.

    "question_text": "In 1906 in New York City, the Warren family got sick with the disease called \"typhoid fever\". Typhoid fever was a scary disease without a cure. First a person would feel tired and feverish, and then they would have muscle aches, weight loss, rash and a swollen abdomen. Quite often typhoid fever would lead to death. A government worker came to the Warren home to investigate and see where the typhoid fever could have come from. As the worker investigated, he took notice of the cook Mary Mallon. Mallon had worked as a cook for many families in the early 1900s and each of them had contracted typhoid fever. It was soon realized that Mary Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever. That meant that she had the disease all the time but she never felt any symptoms of it. She was spreading the disease without even knowing it. Mallon was given the nickname Typhoid Mary. Doctors and scientists were very intrigued by Mallon and wanted to examine her, but she would always refuse. There was even an instance that she chased away doctors with a carving fork. Eventually she was arrested and sent to a prison. Doctors were finally able to determine that her gallbladder was where the dangerous bacteria was and they offered to remove it, but she refused. Mallon was sent to live in a quarantine hospital on North Brother Island in New York. She lived there for three years before she was released. At that point she had to agree to change occupations and not be a cook anymore. Mallon did that for a time but later changed her name to Mary Brown and began working as a cook again. Of course, families became sick and Typhoid Mary was to blame. Mallon kept running from authorities as she went from job to job and people became sick. She was finally stopped after she started an outbreak at the Sloane Hospital for Women in New York City. Mallon was quarantined for the remainder of her life. When she died in 1938, an autopsy revealed that she did in fact have live a typhoid bacteria in her gallbladder. Typhoid Mary's body was cremated and her remains were buried at the st. Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx.",

A research was taken at that time to find out what happened to children who suffer from depression. The study revealed that a dramatic increase in children's depression can increase the risk of life. For example, long-term illness such as diabetes and heart disease are caused by depression. One of the studies shows children with depression behave differently and respond differently to medical treatment. This is why many specialists respond differently to medical treatment. This is why many specialists have tried bringing a cure but no one found a perfect medicine. It is quite rare that children suffer from depression but in the recent study the number has dramatically increased. Nowadays no one doubt about children's depression. It has become a common sickness in a child. Children's depression is still a puzzle for scientists and specialists that needs to be resolved sooner than later.",

You probably think the function of Vitamin D is to maintain strong bones and teeth. But it does that by accident. Its real function is to maintain your blood calcium level in a very narrow range. And the reason for that is if your blood calcium level falls below about 9 milligrams per 100 milliliters, then you're longing to be in a big trouble, and die rather quickly. And thats because blood calcium is important for muscle contraction and nerve transmission. And if you dont have enough of it, you cant contract muscles normally, There can't be normal nerve impulses. And this results in a disease called tetany, where you got these uncontrol convulsions followed by rapid death. Calcium is also important for enzymic activities and blood clotting.",

    "question_text": "Hello, it's Megan. This week I'm going to talk about the difference between translators and interpreters. It's a common misconception that translators and interpreters do the same thing. So I just like to highlight a few similarities and differences between the two. Firstly, translation refers to written communication whereas interpreting refers to verbal communication. So, for example, a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved. But would translate the written evidence used in the case. Secondly, both jobs require different skills. I translate to require the ability to write well and comprehensively into a target language. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their native language. For example, although I can speak French to a good standard. I cannot translate from English to French although I could translate from French to English, which means I'm only halfway there to being an international player. An interpreter needs to be able to speak both languages proficiently. Thirdly, the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ. Both roles acquire years of training, the resulting qualification. But what they can learn from the training will be completely different. So just to be clear, translators will translate written texts and interpreters will translate a verbal communication.",

    "question_title": "Vitamin D",
    "question_text": "Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc. In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and other supplements. \nVery few foods contain vitamin D synthesis of vitamin D in the skin is the major natural source of the vitamin. Demmel synthesis of vitamin D from cholesterol is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UV8 radiation). Vitamin D from the diet or dermal synthesis from sunlight is biologically inactive activation requires enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) in the liver and kidney. Evidence indicates the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure is regulated by a negative feedback loop that prevents toxicity, but because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight, no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine (US) for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin 0 requirements. Accordingly, the Dietary Reference Intake for vitamin D assumes no synthesis occurs, and all of a person's vitamin D is from food intake, although that will rarely occur in practice. As vitamin D is synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlight, It Is not strictly a vitamin and may be considered a hormone as its synthesis and activity occur in different locations. Vitamin D has a significant role in calcium homeostasis and metabolism. Its discovery was due to the effort to find the dietary substance lacking in rickets.",

In the book, Michaels et al., describe not a set of superior Human Resources processes, but a mindset that emphasizes the importance of talent to the success of organizations. \nThe war for talent is intensified by demographic shifts (primarily in the United States and Europe). This is characterized by increasing demand along with decreasing supply (demographically). There are simply fewer post baby-boom workers to replace the baby boom retirement in the US and Europe (though this is not the case in most of East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Central America, South America, or the Middle East Eastern Europe also tends to have similar demographics, namely an aging and shrinking labor force). \nWhile talent Is vague or III defined, the underlying assumption is that for knowledge Intensive industries, the knowledge worker is the key competitive resource. Knowledge based theories of organizations consistently place knowledge workers as a primary, competitive resource. Talent is never explicitly defined in the book, though the Preface notes, 'A certain part of talent elude description: You simply know it when you see it: After several further caveats, the authors go on: We can say, however, that managerial talent is some combination of a sharp strategic mind, leadership ability, emotional maturity, communications skills, the ability to attract and inspire other talented people, entrepreneurial instincts, functional skills, and the ability to deliver results.'

First, I plug in a phone charger. And it didn't even register on this power meter. It uses one hundredth of a light bulb of power. So I don't think the phone chargers can be our NO.1 phone energy consumption. Just taking one hot bath everyday uses the same energy, same power of five light bulbs on all the time, non-stop. And I found I've been steadily using 40 light bulbs worth of gas for heating, making hot air or hot water. And that surprises me. Transport is one of the biggest forms of energy consumption, and it uses about a third about our energy. If you drive an average car 50 kilometers a day, that corresponds to adding 40 light bulbs on all the time. Today, the average British person is using 125 light bulbs of power.

While not claiming too much, citizenship can address core skills, attitudes and values that young people need to consider as they come to terms with a changing world.\n\nThe main problems standing in the way of implementation of citizenship continue to be: the lack of commitment on the part of many school leaders; an insufficient amount of initial and in-service training provision to ensure that every school can call upon teachers with subject expertise; and its uncertain place in the curriculum.",

    "question_text": "Why the bumble bees pick some flowers over others? Researchers have known for a while that flowers color can be a signal. Color in short hand that says to a bee: hey, I get some good quality nectar here, want to stop by for a visit. But new findings show that bees also use color to get clues about a flowers temperature. And according to a study from a British research team published in the journal Nature, some like it hot. Bees use up a lot of energy just stay in warm on some days. In fact, they cant even fly if they are too cold. So if one flower is warmer than another, a bee can save some of its fuel by basking on that flower while its doing its pollinating business. And it turns out that bumble bees consistently do choose warmer flowers over cooler ones, even when the two flowers offer up the same quantity and quality of nectar. Some plants seem to be evolutionarily adapted to be slightly warmer because the warmer ones get visited more by the chilly bees. When it comes to getting pollinated, apparently the heat is on, and that is the buzz.",

    "question_text": "According to a new study carried out by researchers in the United Kingdom, talking is the best way to smoke out a liar. The study found that certain conversation-based techniques can help you recognize when a person is lying to you. Like many methods, this conversation method has a name. It is called Controlled Cognitive Engagement, or CCE for short. The investigation took place at one place where lying can get you into big troublean airport. The researchers asked volunteers to pretend they were real passengers and then lie to airport security agents. Some of the agents used spoken conversation-based methods to question these make-believe passengers. Others depended instead on the person's body language, like lack of eye contact and showing signs of nervousness. The agents talking with the passengers were 20 times more likely to catch the liars. Here are some tips for catching a liar by using the conversational CCE method.\n1. Use open-ended questions.\nThese are the opposite of \"Yes\" and \"No\" questions. Open-ended questions force the person to stretch the story of their lies until they get caught in their own web of lies.\n2. Use the element of surprise\nAsk questions they may not think you are going to ask. Ask questions that are surprising or off-topic. This will make it harder for them to keep lying. Or better still ask them to re-tell an event backwards in time, going from the most recent event to the earliest. This is hard enough to do with the truth, let alone a story of lies.\n3. Watch for changes in confidence and speaking styles\nLiars will often change their speaking style when they are questioned. For example, when they feel in control they may be very talkative. But if they feel they are losing control, they may not talk much at all.",
    "question_answer": " A new study in the UK shows that talking is the best way to find a liar. Using CCE, a person can ask open-ended questions to force the person to stretch the story until they get caught. A person can use the element of surprise by asking off-topic questions that make it harder to continue a lie. One can watch for changes in confidence and speaking styles. \n ",

    "question_text": "In many stressful situations the body's responses can improve our performance. We become more energetic, more alert, and better able to take effective action. But when stress is encountered continually, the body's reactions are more likely to be harmful than helpful to us. The continual speeding up of bodily reactions and the production of stress-related hormones seem to make people more susceptible to heart disease. And stress reactions can reduce the disease-fighting effectiveness of the body's immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to illnesses, ranging from colds to cancer. Stress may also contribute to disease in less direct ways by influencing moods and behavior. People under stress, may become anxious or depressed and as a result may eat too much or too little, have sleep difficulties, or fail to exercise. These behavioral changes may in turn be harmful to their health. In addition, people are more likely to pay attention to certain bodily sensations such as aches and pains when they are under stress and to think that they are sick. If the person were not under stress, the same bodily sensations might not be perceived as symptoms and the person might continue to feel well. Some researchers have suggested that assuming the role of a sick person is one way in which certain people try to cope with stress. Instead of dealing with the stressful situation directly, these people fall sick. After all, it is often more acceptable in our society to be sick and to seek medical help than it is to admit that one cannot cope with the stresses of life.",

    "question_text": "One of the biggest challenges facing employers and educators today is the rapid advance of globalization. The market place is no longer national or regional, but extends to all corners of the world. And this requires a global-ready workforce. Universities have a large part to play in preparing students for the 21st century labor market by promoting international educational experiences. The most obvious way universities can help develop a global workforce is by encouraging students to study abroad as part of their course. Students who have experienced another culture firsthand are more likely to be global-ready when they graduate. Global workforce development doesn't always have to involve travel abroad, however. If students learn another language and study other cultures, they will be more global-ready when they graduate. It is important to point out that students also need to have a deep understanding of their own culture before they can begin to observe, analyze and evaluate other cultures. In multi-cultural societies, people can study each other's cultures to develop intercultural competencies, such as critical and reflective thinking and intellectual flexibility. This can be done both through the curriculum and through activities on campus outside of the classroom, such as art exhibitions and lectures from international experts.",

    "question_text": "More than fifty years ago, the United Nations declared that literacy is a basic human right. It's very important for improving the lives of individuals. However, it is estimated that 818 million adults around the world are illiterate, that is, they are unable to read or write. A majority of them are women. More than 110 million school age children in the world do not attend school. Many others complete school or fail to finish their studies without learning to read or write. Many countries depend on the efforts of people who offer their time to help illiterate individuals. For example, John Mogger became concerned about the problem of illiteracy three years ago, so he started teaching five prisoners in Brazil. In his teaching, he developed a system with this group of prisoners. He says his way of teaching can help anyone learn how to read and write with about thirty hours of study. To learn his system, people must first know how to write letters of the alphabet and learn which sounds they represent. The system divides letters into three groups. The first group of letters can be written between two lines. The second can be written between two lines but part of the letter is above the top line. The third group has letters that are partly written below the lower line. John Mogger taught his students to write simple words from the letters. In this way, his students learned more than seven hundred words. Many of them can now write to family members. They also can read newspapers and magazines.",

A robot that can drive itself on sidewalks to make door-to-door deliveries is going to be tried out in London and some as-yet-undisclosed U.S. cities in the coming months. Here is a picture of the small, black-and-white, slightly rounded machine on six wheels, a brand-new product of the London-based developer, Starship Technologies. It can blend in with the pedestrian traffic. Lightweight, it can only carry a small amount in its top compartment - two grocery bags or small packages up to nine kilograms. The company's chief executive officer, who also co-founded Skype, said the unnamed robot is practical, safe and environmentally friendly. \nA user would place an order online, as what people do right now, but instead of getting the delivery by somebody coming up to and knocking on your door, you would get it by a robot. The electric rover isn't made for long distances. Moving at 6.5 kilometers per hour, which is 4 miles per hour it can travel up to 5 kilometers and from a local store or retail outlet it can complete deliveries within a half hour. An advantage for customers is that we can use a smartphone app to decode when we want deliveries to arrive. You know, we call up the delivery using our smartphone, and then the robot gets loaded with our parcel and drives to our doorstep.",

Some nations use English as their official language, performing the function of administration; in others it's used as an international language for business, commerce and industry.\nWhat factors and forces have led to the spread of English? Why English is now considered to be so prestigious that, across the globe, individuals and societies feel disadvantaged if they do not have competence in this language? How has English changed through 1,500 years? These are some of the questions that you investigate when you study English.\nYou also examine the immense variability of English and come to understand how it's used as a symbol of both individual identity and social connection. You develop in-depth knowledge of the intricate structure of the language. Why do some non-native speakers of English claim that it's a difficult language to learn, while infants born into English-speaking communities acquire their language before they learn to use forks and knives? At the University of Sussex, you are introduced to the nature and grammar of English in all its aspects. This involves the study of sound structures, the formation of words, the sequencing of words and the construction of meaning, as well as examination of the theories explaining these aspects of English usage.

    "question_text": "New research by Dr. Leanne ten Brinke at the Haas School of Business suggests that, while most of us have pretty good instincts when it comes to recognizing liars, we tend to talk ourselves out of believing what our instincts are telling us. We hesitate to call liars out in professional environments because we feel guilty for being suspicious. Calling someone a liar for no good reason is a frightening proposition for most.\nThankfully, Dr. Brinke's research points to objective well-documented physiological and behavioral changes that we can use to make accurate assessments of other people's truthfulness.\nKeep an eye out for the following signs, and you won't be taken advantage of by a liar.\nThey cover their mouths. A hand on the mouth or even a touch of the lips shows you that they are lying because this unconscious body language represents a closing off of communication. When lying, people also instinctively cover vulnerable body parts, such as the head or neck, because lying makes them feel exposed, vulnerable, and open to attack.\nThey repeat themselves and provide too much detail. Liars hate silence, so they often try to fill it up by talking more than they need to. They provide far more information than was needed or asked for. Sometimes the longer you stay quiet the more details liars will throw in to support their story as they try to convince you and themselves of their cheating. \nThey prepare for an escape. In an unconscious attempt to find an escape route, people who are lying often angle their bodies towards the door if they're sitting, and if they're standing, they may even move closer to the door.",

    "question_text": "If the authorities want to tell the world some good news, they issue statements and call press conferences. Or politicians make speeches. Local newspapers, radio and television help to alert foreign correspondents to what is going on. And by making contacts with local officials, journalists can ask for more information or explanation to help them write their stories. Unless the correspondent is an eye-witness, it's rare to trust any single source. Officials have a policy to defend, and opposition politicians want to attack it. Rumor and gossip can also confuse the situation. So, you have to check information as much as possible using common sense and experience as final checks to help establish just what's likely to be the truth, or close to it.\nJust getting the news is only half the job. A correspondent may be well-informed but his job is to inform other people, the public. So once the information is available it has to be written in an interesting way which is also easily understood. Particularly for radio, since, while a newspaper reader can turn back and re-read a sentence or two, the radio listener has only one chance. This also means that only a limited number of facts can be contained in a sentence, that there should be an element of repetition. And vital information necessary to understand the latest development should be presented at the start of a report  in case the producer of a news program decides to shorten an item, by cutting for example the last sentence or two.",

We can travel swiftly, and usually safely, over the roads which have been built to accommodate our cars. People can display their wealth by driving a car which may cost as much as another person's home.\nSadly the car has become a disadvantage as well as a boon. The car pollutes the atmosphere, may be involved in serious accidents, and by its very numbers blocks roads. How can we reduce its use? The car is only desirable if we can use it easily, so we might begin by reducing access to parking spaces in the cities and simultaneously increasing the quality and availability of public transport. Cars could be banned from certain parts of the city, thus forcing people to walk or to use public transport. The expense of buying and running a car can be raised. If the motorist is faced with a high purchase price, high road tax, high insurance premiums and substantial fines he or she may reconsider the purchase. A corresponding reduction in the price of public transport would help this financial argument against car ownership. Neither of these arguments will sway the super-rich who can afford the status cars, but it would perhaps encourage them to look at other ways of demonstrating their wealth.",

    "question_text": "We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us. People who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be bad. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife.\nAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced. And good, close relationships seem to shelter us from some of the hardship of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy.\nAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of the couples in their 80s or 90s could quarrel with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those quarrels didn't do huge harm on their memories.",

Secondly, quality of a close relationship matters since it can shelter people from the hardships of getting old. Thirdly, good relationships protect our brains and don't have to be smooth all the time. If a person can count on their partner, the quarrels don't do harm on memories. \n ",

They want to do some banking at night and on weekends. For such people their problems may soon be over. Before long, they may be able to do their banking from the comfort of their own home, any hour of the day, any day of the week. Many banks are preparing online branches or Internet offices, which means that people will be able to take care of much of their banking business through their home computers. This process is called interactive banking. At gaze online branches, customers will be able to view all their accounts, move money between their accounts, apply for a loan, and get current information on products such as credit cards. Customers will also be able to pay their bills electronically and even email questions to the bank.\nBanks are creating online services for several reasons. One reason is that banks must compete for customers, who will switch to another bank if they are dissatisfied with the service they receive. The convenience of online banking appeals to the kind of customer banks most want to keep, that is, people who are young, well-educated and have good incomes. Banks also want to take advantage of modern technology since they have moved into the 21st century.",

There was no atmosphere, so we brought in a pool table and fruit machines. When football players choose to spend time together, it generates a better atmosphere.

    "question_text": "Objects that are vibrating make sounds. Rhythmic sound vibrations produce sound waves which travel in every direction. The frequency of a sound is the number of waves that pass a given point each second. The more rapidly an object vibrates the greater the frequency of sound it makes. Frequency is measured in hertz. One hertz equals one sound wave per second. The frequency of sound determines the degree of highness or lowness of the sound. A high-pitched sound has a higher frequency than a low-pitched sound. Humans hear sounds that have frequencies from about 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz. Sound with a frequency higher than 20,000 hertz is called ultrasound which is too high-pitched for humans to hear. However, many animals can hear ultrasound. Bats can hear higher sounds than any other animal. Some can hear up to 210,000 hertz. Bats send out lots of high-pitched squeaks and then listen to the echoes bouncing off things like insects. The shorter the time interval between the squeak and the echo, the closer they are to the insect. Using sound to find or \"see\" things is called echolocation. Another animal that uses ultrasound is the dolphin. Dolphins can hear sounds up to about 150,000 hertz. Dolphins use sound waves to find food underwater. They make clicking sounds that hit whatever is around them and then bounce back to the dolphins. Dolphins can send as many as 2,000 clicks per second. Dolphins' ultrasound ability is so sensitive that they can detect small fish from 10 feet away.",

For instance, at Washington's National Airport jet traffic is not allowed from 11 pm to 7 am. Other airports restrict the use of certain runways. One estimate is that noise restrictions reduce possible airport use by 20 percent.

    "question_text": "Moods, say the experts, are feelings that are likely to be fixed, having effects on one's outlook for hours, days, weeks or even years. That's great if your mood is a pleasant one, but it will be a problem if you are sad, anxious, angry or simply lonely.\nPerhaps the best way to deal with such moods is to talk them out; sometimes, though, there is no one to listen. Moderne pharmacy offers a lot of anti-anxiety drugs. What many people don't realize, however, is that scientists have discovered the effectiveness of several non-drug methods to make you free from an unwanted mood. These can be just as useful as drugs, and have the added benefit of being non-poisonous. So next time you feel out of sorts, don't head for the drug store try the following method.\nOf all the mood-changing self-help techniques, aerobic exercise seems to be the best cure for a bad mood. \"If you could keep the exercise, you'd be in high spirits,\" says Kathryn Lance, author of Running for Health and Beauty. Researchers have explained biochemical and various other changes that make exercise seem preferable to drugs as a mood-raiser. Physical work such as housework, however, does little. The key is aerobic exercise - running, cycling, walking, swimming, or other repetitive activities that increase the heart rate and circulation, and improve the consumption of oxygen.  You may do them for at least 20 minutes a time, three to five times a week.",

    "question_text": "Today, class, I am going to speak to you about the Industrial Revolution. The term \"industrial revolution\" refers to the technological, social, economic, and cultural changes that occurred in England in the late eighteenth century. This change eventually spread around the world, creating many big cities. Before the Industrial Revolution, the production and harvesting of products was completed through manual labor. The Industrial Revolution replaced this manpower with machine power. \nOne of the first, and perhaps most important, developments of the Industrial Revolution was the steam engine. This advance in transportation allowed for the faster delivery of manufactured goods. However, the steam engine wasn't only used for transportation but instead for the construction of machine engines that made faster production possible. For example, before the Industrial Revolution, most tasks were done by either wind or water power or by the strength of man or horse. But, in 1698, a man by the name of Thomas Savery constructed the first steam-powered engine in London. Thomas Savery, an engineer and inventor, patented a machine that could effectively draw water from flooded mines using steam pressure. \nThe development of the steam engine caused a host of other changes technologically, socially and economically within British culture. Steam engine technology lead to the development of factories, where products were turned out in the hundreds or even thousands. The factory industry eventually gave rise to what we now know as the modern city.",
    "question_answer": " The industrial Revolution brought many social, economic and cultural changes. It changed labour from man power to machine power. The most important development of this was the steam engine, which made faster delivery and production possible. It was invented by Thomas Savery and lead to developing factories and the modern city.\n  \n ",

Alzheimer's disease can be exhausting for caregivers and frightening to those who have it. People with Alzheimer's disease said, \"The worst thing that I found was I was getting lost in the car, not just forgetting where I was going, I wouldn't know where I was.\"\nThe World Health Organization estimates that more than 47 million people suffer from dementia, with about 60 percent of them in low and middle-income countries, countries with the least ability to cope.

    "question_text": "Ever lose your ability to taste during a cold, because your nose is stuffed up? That's because the nose is intimately involved with taste. When you chew, flavor compounds from the food may enter the back of your mouth. And when you breathe out, you carry some of those flavor compounds up into your nasal cavity. \n\"As children we basically learn, the first lesson of table manners is to keep the mouth closed while chewing, and you also want to breathe smoothly.\" Randy, a mechanical engineer at Penn State said, \"I think this is not only because it's polite, but also because you can smell the food much better if you can breathe smoothly.\" Smell contributes to taste by this \"backdoor\". And it turns out our airways are particularly tuned to enhance that effect.\nRandy and his colleagues 3D-printed a model of a woman's airway. To track airflow, they mixed water with special particles and pumped it through the model, filming the results. They found that when you breathe in, that inward airflow actually forms a curtain at the back of your mouth, blocking food particles from getting into the lungs, which is a good thing. And when you breathe out, air swirls through that cavity in the back of the mouth, sweeping up those particles and delivering them right to the nasal cavity, where you can smell them.",
    "question_answer": "A person's nose is connected to taste due to flavor compounds that travel up to a person's nasal cavity when eating. One can smell the food better if they can breathe smoothly with their mouth closed. When a person breathes in, the back of the throat forms a curtain to block food getting into their lungs, but also sends particles to the nasal cavity for smell.",

    "question_text": "Over the past 100 years, the technology of airplanes has changed, but the controls are still similar. You see, an airplane has three axes. Each axis has its own set of fins built into the aircraft's wings. When a pilot moves the fins in the air stream, they react with the air pressure to turn the aircraft.\nThere are three basic turns of today's airplane. A turn in the lateral axis can make the plane move up or down. A turn in the vertical axis can make the plane left or right. The third axis is the longitudinal axis. This turns the plane spin or roll. For the first two types of turns, the fins turn in the direction of the desired turn. For a spin, the fins turn in opposite directions. To make a turn on the lateral or vertical axis, a pilot needs only to turn the fins in the direction of the desired turn. For example, if the pilot wants to turn left, he would turn the vertical axis left. The air stream that flows around the aircraft would change, and the aircraft would turn left.\nTo achieve a spin, the fins go in opposite directions. For example, to spin clockwise, the right fin would turn down, so the right side of the aircraft drops. The left fin would turn right, so that the left side of the aircraft would rise. With one side rising and one side dropping, the aircraft then would perform a spin or roll.",

    "question_text": "Many economists say U.S. growth will accelerate a bit soon, which will likely make it easier for other nations to sell their products in the world's biggest economy. Surging energy production is cutting costs and spurring U.S. economic growth, but rising interest rates are acting as brakes on expansion. Some shops are busier, because the United States and other wealthy nations are shaking off the recession and making more economic contribution. \nKey sectors of the U.S. economy, like housing, are strongly influenced by interest rates. Lower rates make it easier for families to borrow the money to buy homes and businesses to get the equipment they need to expand. With that in mind, the U.S. central bank has been endeavoring to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates. Part of that effort involves buying tens of billions of dollars of securities each month, a program that is being reduced or \"tapered.\" If the stimulus continues for too long, it might spark inflation, which could hurt the economy.\nA surge in U.S. energy production will help overcome the impact of rising interest rates. Oil industry experts say growing use of hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\" has sharply increased U.S. production of oil and natural gas. The wider use of fracking is boosting U.S. oil production, cutting the cost of crude oil imports, and leaving people with more money to consume. Critics say burning more fossil fuels may increase climate change and voice concerns about the impact of fracking on the environment and public health.",

However, high interest rates are stopping expansion, and now the US central bank is now reducing these.

But, this wasn't always the case.\nIn the early days of radio, stations were capable of broadcasting only a narrow range of sounds, which was all right for the human voice but music didn't sound very good. There was also a great deal of crackling and other static noises that further interfered with the quality of the sound.\nA man named Edwin Armstrong, who was a music lover, set out to change this. He invented FM radio, a technology that allowed stations to send a broad range of frequencies that greatly improved the quality of the music. Now, you'd think that this would have made him a millionaire; it didn't.\nRadio stations at that time had invested enormous amounts of money in the old technology. So the last thing they wanted was to invest millions more in the new technology. Nor did they want to have to compete with other radio stations that had a superior sound and could put them out of business. So they pressured the Federal Communications Commission the department of the United States government that regulates radio stations to put restrictive regulations on FM radio.\nThe result was that its use was limited to a very small area around New England. Of course as we all know, Edwin Armstrong's FM technology eventually prevailed and was adopted by thousands of stations around the world. But this took years of court battles and he never saw how it came to affect the lives of almost everyone.",

But stickler for accuracy might call poinsettias \"long-night\" plants, because what prompts their flowering isn't the short days of winter, but the long nights.",
    "question_answer": "Biologists have found that exposing plants to darkness has no effect on their flowering cycle, however, exposing them to light during the night does. Many plants are considered day length sensitive, for instance, poinsettias are called \"short-day\" plants due to the fact that they flower in winter from the long nights.",

    "question_text": "If you haven't cleaned out your refrigerator in a while, there might be a nasty surprise waiting for you. There, in a forgotten piece of Tupperware, lurks the ravioli you didn't finish three weeks ago. Opening the lid with curiosity and fear, you're confronted by a blue-green mess that only vaguely resembles pasta.\nThe lesson here seems to be that even when a jar or container is resealed and refrigerated, the food inside inevitably succumbs to a moldy end. Actually, it depends on the food. For instance, when's the last time you noticed that your honey had gone bad?\nApparently, a jar of honey that's been opened and resealed can stay on the shelf for years without going bad. Archaeologists have even found ancient jars with unspoiled honey inside.\nSo what's the secret to this longevity? Most food ferments when bacteria living in it eat sugars and nutrients in the food. The bacteria subsequently produce waste in the form of acids and other chemicals that affect the appearance, smell, and taste of the food. In other words, bacterial waste is what causes food to rot and appear moldy. But like most life forms, bacteria need water to thrive. While many foods contain a good deal of water, honey contains almost none.\nWhat little water exists in honey binds to its sugars and enzymes, leaving little for bacterial growth. Unsealed, honey will attract water from the air and eventually ferment. But sealed, honey lasts for ages. Of course, even sealed honey will eventually crystallize and turn hard, but this doesn't mean it's spoiled. In fact, even years later, it's as good as new.",
    "question_answer": "The decomposition of food depends on a few factors. Honey, for example, can go unspoiled if unopened since food ferments from bacteria which thrive on water and sugar, producing waste that eventually rots the food, yet honey has no water. In fact, if honey remains sealed it can last for ages; however, if it's unsealed it will attract water from the air and rot like most foods.",
